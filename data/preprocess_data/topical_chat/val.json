Do you know about ESPN winning an emmy?","Yes and that superimposed line made life a little easier, lol! Hard to believe that there are only 11 minutes of live game play.","Yes, what did they do the rest of the time?","I know right! Did you know that in the 60's top bowler made more than top nfl players?","I do. They now make pennies compared to professional football players.","I would hope so, just goes to show how little the nfl paid back then. Do you know what the highest scoring football game was?","NFL or college football?","Think college back in the day when they wore those ridiculous helmets.","Cumberland was defeated by Georgia Tech. The scores were 222-0. It was in 1916.","Yup and i know my hint helped, lol. Did you know in Austria they call football rugby?","Yes. I wonder why though. Do you know why?","Apparently the different variations are called football codes. It's called other things in other countries.","Green-Ellis, an RB, has never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.","Now that's an achievement. Do you know if he's in the hall of fame?","No, I do not think so other wise I would have heard.","Do you watch tv at all?

Great chats!"],"emotion":["positive","informed","happy"]},{"dialogue":["I love to watch TV, what about you?","Do you prefer watching NFL or attending the event?","I would prefer live it the weather's good. The bad thing is that the possibility of injury is a big concern, especially for QBs.","Ah see. Most of the stadiums can be changed to indoors.. right? I feel like people watch the game for the QB..","I'm not sure how many are outdoors only. I like to watch managers and coaches like Gruden. Fun to see their reactions.","The pissed off reactions?","Sometimes. Sometimes it's a happy reaction. Like when Brad Johnson threw a TD pass to himself in a Superbowl!","I don't really know how NFL came to be though. There's so many different variations of football that exist... rugby, gridiron, soccer... just so many","I think there were college people that still wanted to play. 14 of the 25 largest stadiums are U.S. college stadiums.","With all the prevention on the high school level against concussions... isn't that the end of the game already if the parents don't want their kids to go into football?","I played in HS and my parents made the call. My mom didn't like the idea. I didn't have my dad do the fight song like Snoop Dogg's son.","Hopefully you are still throwing the ball around on your free time?","Yeah, I do with my nephew and brother once in a while. My son's are far away unfortunately. I'm no QB through and not left-handed like Kellan Moore (the only left-handed QB in the NFL)","Are you able to run and do carries like adrian peterson?","Yeah, in my dreams. Did you know that only two African-American QBs have won the Superbowl. Too bad Warren Moon didn't.","there also seems to be more records being broken every year... especially when the Patriots have been at the superbowl so many times...","Yeah. I wonder in Homer Simpson has a record for having 188 jobs in 400 episodes?","Lol. gotta love the simpsons. been on the air for so long.","Yeah. I still get a kick out of Homer. I\\'m not much for things like \"The Shark Tank.\" I hear the deals they make are phony.","Well a lot of people go on shark tank just to get the name out. I think that does wonder than actually get a deal with any of the members on shark tank.","That's true. Thanks, you were an excellent chat partner!"],"emotion":["positive","satisfied"]},{"dialogue":["Hey there do you have a favorite quarterback? I personally don't watch the NFL that much but I do like Tom Brady","I think it's 6 at this point isn't it? another quarterback I like is Kellen Moore. He's the only left-handed quarterback in the league","Why the small number of lefties? Does it have something to do with setting up the offense differently for a lefty?","It might be? I wonder if it gives him an advantage or a disadvantage being left-handed? what quarterbacks are geniuses though like Alex Smith oh, have you heard of him","Alex Smith? What team does he play for? Why is he a genius?","Well he took a lot of AP tests when he was in high school and so he got into his university as a junior. Then he got his bachelor's degree in only 2 years and was almost through his master's degree before becoming the first choice in the 2005 draft","Impressive. Got through college that fast, then studied at the graduate level while playing ball? Bright guy.","Yes I think so. Another interesting guy is Baker Mayfield. He's a quarterback and thought about becoming a professional gamer before finally getting drafted into the NFL","I wonder how many girls he would get as a gamer. Seems like the popularity factor is better with the NFL.","Oh he made the right choice haha. Another guy who made the right choice is Paul D Hubbard, he was a deaf quarterback and created the circular huddle that football players use today","I guess I thought the huddle was something that was there from the beginning. A deaf QB? I wonder how well he did.","That's what I was wondering too. I guess maybe he could still yell out calls and different things like audibles, but you'd think that you would have to be hearing in order to be a quality quarterback. But he did invent the Huddle so he's done more for football than me haha","True. What do you think of U of Iowa's locker room painting tactic?","I don't know, I'd be curious if that would help or hurt them. If I went into a locker room and it was painted tank it would make me mad and I would play better I think haha. What do you think?","I would get mad too. If that tactic worked, then other teams would copy it.","Yep I think so. Although I wonder if that's what happened for the highest scoring football game of all time. It was 222 to 0 maybe the winning team had the other team's locker room painted pink LOL","that's true. Or maybe somebody goofed when they made the schedule. Why would GT do that to a team? Seems wrong.","I know right! It's a hundred to zero I think the game is officially over haha. Do you like the Patriots at all? I know they have a player that's never fumble the ball which I think is awesome","I hope he got a bonus for that feat. That's amazing. He must have special gloves or something. What's his name?","His name is benjarvis Green-Ellis, and yes you must have a secret as to how he was able to pull that off haha although I would be very concerned every time I played because every game you play is a chance to ruin that record haha"],"emotion":["happy","positive","interesting","curious"]},{"dialogue":["Hello how are you doing?","I love it. Did you know that top bowlers used to make more than football stars did?","I love it also! That is interesting, I wonder how much more football players make now than bowlers","I would say it is a whole lot these days.","I agree lol. Did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard field in chicago","thats amazing. Look what it has grown into. Billions of dollars in it. Millions and millions of fans. Its great.","Right! Now they even have chip technology in players should pads tracking data for them","That really is amazing technology. Did you know that Benjarvis green ellis has never fumbled in his career.","I heard that before, that is a great feat! He needs to teach a clinic to these new era RBs on how to hold on to the ball!","Well there had to be a touch of luck involved. He played for a long time.","for sure! I liked his name lol. Do you know the Lions coach Matt Patricia?","Yeah didnt he use to coach in new england","Yea the assistant, now coaches the Lions. The guy is a rocket scientist!","Really. I wonder if that helps him with football at all. Other than having a really good mind.","I was thinking the same thing. Do you watch college football at all?","Not really. I did hear that the University of Iowas visiting locker room is painted pink. I thought that was pretty funny.","That is true, I live down the street from that stadium. It is because pink has a natural calming effect on people who see it!","Yeah Im sure thats why. Lol.","For sure, maybe why they are good at home for football.

Got to have something going on there to want to play in the NFL but yah, too many concussions is way too much and too many people getting hurt.","Yeah traumatic brain injuries that are also difficult to diagnose, the symptoms take a long time to disappear.","They do, usually caused by repeated blows to the head, very difficult to diagnose indeed. It's something but no one wants to pay attention to it it seems.","Did you watch that movie the one with Will Smith? I thought it was revealing and the game should evolve and change for the better","What was that movie called again? I did see it, was it called Concussion right?","Yeah I think thats it, self explained name when you think about it and also \\'\\'chronic traumatic encephalopathy\" sounds like a serious condition.","That line \"Tell the truth\" is pretty iconic in my opinion, it was a good movie for sure. Made me view the NFL a bit different. I guess it makes us think if millions of dollars for a few years is worth all that?","I don't think it is, I do love the game but think it should be safer for players. Have you ever heard of Gaelic football?","I have not, what is Gaelic Football? Is it like rugby?","Its another variation of football haven't watched it but I guess its also really interesting.","Very interesting. I wonder if it has more than 11 minutes of live football like the NFL has on average per game.","That is not a lot of time, the Superbowl was really long lasted more than 3 hours","Oh wow, that was such a boring Super Bowl though, Tom Brady is so good, and I'm not even a fan of his lol.","Yeah, he is one of the best QB ever to play the game. Engineers end up earning more money than football players","I could see that, I'm sure NFL players have a lot more fun in their 20s, maybe not so much their 40s and 50s though when they are so sore haha.","I have no idea about that lol, what are your thoughts on the tracking chips the players have embedded in their shoulders.","I think it's pretty cool, the chips help them with their analytics, that's why you see so many 3's in the NBA now, they've studied all the data and for some people it's beneficial to lob 3s instead of jumpers.","Oh so you are basketball fan as well and yeah it is pretty cool all the interesting stats we can learn thanks to those chips.","For sure, data is really changing the world.

Much like the lannisters of football","They have dominated the NFL for a while so yeah, thats a valid analogy,","Ya and they have amazing players like brady. Surprised he is still playing, but his performance is still solid","I agree, he is 40 years old but still one of the best QB on the league, wonder how much money he makes, must be a lot","I hear his wife still makes more. Power couple","She is a famous model or was a famous model to think engineers actually end up winning more than pro football players","I think it is due to the high rate of injury leading to early retirement for many players","Yeah, football players carreers seem to be short due to injuries, did you hear about the tracking chips they have?","In their shoulder pads or in the football?","Both, I guess that they give all kinds of interesting stats,","I wonder if it is any help in reducing injuries","I think it could, if you meassure the impact and then find a way to protect the players","I don't think protective football gear has evolved much","No, I hear they wanted to change certain rules to protect players but easier said than done,","In any case, I hope less people get injured.

All the way back in 1916.","This years football season has ended and now it is time for the playoffs.","The best team from the NFC will play the best team from the AFC. This is called the superbowl.","Do you prefer the American version of football or the English or Australian versions?","The American version for sure.","ESPN has added a field goal line to their emmy winning yellow line for first downs","I find it interesting there is no rule preventing women from playing in the NFL.","I hope to see one in the NFL sooner, at least as a kicker","That would be interesting.

I like the commercial with the two football players who make cupcakes.","Ha ha. Troy Aikman disagrees with expanding the season by two games on account of the players health and he has many supporters with the recent research regarding brain health. I agree with Troy.","Does mean sickness or injuries?","Injuries leading to brain damage over time. Jones has countered by saying they could shorten the pre-season by two games to even it out and it would be even safer. But I disagree with that because teams are more careful with their players in pre-season for fear of them being injured for the actual season when it counts.","I don't know. CTE is dangerous, but they can't diagnosis it officially until someone is dead due to the way the test is performed on the brain,","True but they seem to be finding at least some degree of it in the majority of autopsies they have performed. Jones also cited more money as a reason to extend the season which I believe is his only real motivation. I find that upsetting when he has to have more money than he could possibly spend at this point. It's very greedy.","It's greedy and dangerous","That's true. It seems to damage their impulse control. He says the players would make more but there is no guarantee of that and I don't think it's worth their health. They are already making a staggering amount of money.","I think it won't pass. NFL is a big corporation.","I don't think it will either. Did you know that the average football game only has 11 minutes of actual live game play! I knew that they felt way too full of commercials and interruptions.","Yes, the commercials make a lot of money.","Yes, that is a prime advertising time. I do not like the way they treat their cheerleaders. Saints cheerleaders aren't even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players and if a player enters and they are already eating, they have to stop eating and leave.","That's probably due to sexual harassment. There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.","Not sure because i also recently found out that the cheerleaders make nearly minimum wage which is ridiculous. That's interesting. I know those were the height of entertainment at one point but I wonder if they hold up now.","Radios are interesting. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.","That's pretty fascinating especially given the distance.","Yeah, I wonder if aliens listen to music.","I know we have sent music into space just in case.","I didn't know that.

Engineers have a much higher lifetime earning than NFL players do!","Maybe thats because they tend to have longer carreers but I agree, football also causes brain damage and unwanted injuries","Right and who wants that. I guess the cheerleaders could also go out for the team, since there is no ban of female players!

They are no match physicaly. It would probably be them who needs to be worried about injuries.","But people hurt themselves without the aid of the others team.

I like the QB position the most since they are the core of the offense. Do you like any position in particular?","It is a battle of experience versus youth.

Hubbard, so the opposing team could not read his hand signals?","Yes, also kellan moor is the only left handed QB in the nfl.

Do you think they will every have female players?","Well the nfl doesn't have any written rule against female players","We will have to wait and see. Some of the traditions in football are peculiar, if not humorous. For example, Saints chearleaders cannot be in the same resturant with any NFL player, even if they were there first.","I agree. However, I think there are some interesting things going on for the NFL, not just on the team level. For instance, they are putting chips into players shoulderpads and footballs to gather data and make better plays","I would have liked to have known the G forces the Saints receiver took in that \"no call pass interference\" play in the playoff game with the Rams. What do you think of the salaries. We know what the stars make, but not the backups and the 2nd string. I wonder how the average salary with the short career span stacks up against other jobs?","Well the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl, but you have to remember as you pointed out the hour they work respectively.","They do earn more per hour playing, but it is a short career, often 10 years or less, while a good engineer would likely get 35-40 years of service.

Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the TV yellow line showing the first down position?","Well the yellow line definitely helped many viewers better digest the situation and action on the field","I agree. With the yellow line, you can really visualize how far they need to move the ball. It also lets the armchair QBs speculate on what plays the real QBs will call. Most of these guys are really smart. Did you know QB Alex Smith entered college as a Junior and was working on a Masters when he entered the NFL draft?","I agree that most of these guys are brilliant. I mean the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, but so much goes on in those few minutes that the espn won an emmy for helping to break it down and these players have to make the smart decision in fractions of seconds","I agree, but they also have coach to QB communications in the QB's helmet these days.

It's something we take for granted, Kellan Moore is the sole left-handed quarterback in the whole league, I wonder if that is an advantage or not.","Huh, interesting.

I have a young daughter and would hate for her to want to be a cheerleader.","Mine doesn't cheer, as I don't like the culture. My son's girlfriend plays football for their school, she's their kicker. I'm surprised no NFL team has a woman kicker.","Well there is no rule against it. I'm sure there would be a lot of fuss in the media for a few weeks, and then once she played it would be forgotten. I know in UK soccer they have women referees, once they started doing it everyone got over it.","Do they also have tracking chips in their balls over there\/","Probably, I know most big sports leagues track just about everything the players do, always looking for that edge.","Thats insane. I think it's invasive, and wouldn't want a tracker in my shoulder pads, if I were a player.","I think the compensation football players get now would allow me to get over it. Although I think we assume most players are set for life after a career, it might not be true.","Maybe. I still can't believe ESPN won an Emmy for that superimposed yellow line. Must have been a bad year, if they won for that.","I suppose if you are really into the game it matters to you, remembering a number in your head can be difficult. I remember my son wondering how the line moved on the pitch when he was really young.","It's interesting that Baker Mayfield thought about becoming a pro gamer. I wonder how that would have worked out for him.","I've been hearing more and more about pro gaming, apparently there is money in in now. Colleges have started offering scholarships for e-sport league players. Not sure how I feel about that, I guess it's safer than football.","He is a Halo 3 guru, I guess. If they are at that level, then they probably make more than what a scholarship is worth. I know some of the pros make millions.","I wonder how long a pro gamer career lasts? If it's not longer than a football players they will run into the same issue where a regular career pays more than a short sports career.","I suppose as long as their reflexes hold out. It's funny, pro bowlers used to make more than pro football players.","I think a pro bowling career might last a little longer, doesn't seem much chance of injury. ESPN needs to come up with an innovation for bowling, its very repetitive.","The same could be said for footall.","Guess you have a point, I still don't understand how you can turn 11 minutes of play into three hours of TV. It's been good chatting to you.","I don't understand that either, any more than I understand why there is only one left handed quarterback.

I had a friend that was in Rugby club years and years ago.","Cool I love soccer, follow the FC barcelona... but do not know anything about Australian football!","That's funny. That same friend was from England and was big on Manchester United. The average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay. Seems crazy to pay all that money for a ticket when looked at from that perspective.","Seems like it but the reality is that the whole show if worth it and with the tracking chip you get info like the ball speed, the velocity and that adds to the average 11 minute hahaha","lol The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player.","Oh wow.

Do you recall by any chance what were the teams playing that game at that year?","I believe it was in Chicago Stadium on an 80 yard long dirt field!","Oh Wow!!! I didn't know this. Do you know what was the highest score ever in a football game?","Yes and the field was home to the chicago blackhawks at the time. No, what was the highest score ever?","I think you answered the wrong question. What was the highest score ever recorded in a football game, do you know?","Sorry I was just telling you more about the field whether first playoff games held. I don't know the highest score ever. What was it?","That's okay. It was a game between Georgia Tech crushing Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.","Holy cow how does that even happen? I bet Matt Patricia would never let that happen. He is the only rocket scientist coaching in the NFL.","Yes I heard that Matt Patricia is a rocket scientist a while back in my local news and when he was our defensive coordinator under Bill Belichick.","Oh wow. He graduated from a school whose fight song includes Sin, Cosine, and Tangent lol.","I didn't know this. That is very interesting. Matt Patricia is a really smart guy and I think he will be great as a Lions head coach.","Yes I agree with you. Do you like watching high school football? It is huge in Texas, they have a stadium that cost $60 million to build.","I don't really watch high school football these day but that is a lot of money to build a high school stadium.","Yes it is. It seats 18,000 people.","Nice. Did you know that Alex Smith received his Bachelor's Degree in just a couple of years?","That is amazing he sounds so smart.

Definitely a hard worker.","I think NFL players make a lot of money these days, so I bet he's glad to be on a team again. However, I didn't know that bowlers in 1960 made more than football stars.","That is kinda crazy, I wonder how much that pay was, and what the gap is today.","It's probably not as much as it was in 1960 - twice as much, wow. That makes me want to take up bowling! I think the game Peterson played wasn't a very clear win, only a few scores. There was one game in 1916 where the final score was 222-0. I didn't know the game could go that high!","Neither did I . That is a pretty large gap. In most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway, that game must have had a lot more.","Yeah. I didn't realize it was only around 11 minutes of actual play. Thinking about it, though, I guess they time all the huddles and positioning. I didn't know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback. I thought that began with the game so they could all hear each other.","It is amazing that what they come up with, the huddle has become iconic.","Yes it has become iconic. This Peterson is called a running back. Is that the guy who tries to throw it to the quarterback or tries to catch the ball?","He is the guy that the quarterback hands the ball off to.","Oh ok. I knew the quarterback was an important guy for offense, but Peterson's position sounded important too. I think football players have a lot of pressure to do well. Apparently the NFL uses chips to track lots of stats about them. I wonder if that affects their pay.","Im not sure, but I know they do use the data from the chips to make play safer for them and make their pads better.","That's a good thing. I think they can easily get injured without pads. I think padding is more like the American kind of football. I've seen some clips of rugby played without pads. That looks pretty rough.","Yeah, Gaelic football is the same way, Im not sure how it works but it isnt for the weak.","I personally like the European type of football, also called soccer. I like the strategy and skill. I've been to an international soccer game before, it was really awesome to watch.","Me too. I always played growing up. I loved watching the world cup this past summer.","I haven't watched sports lately. It's funny how things change, like how Tom Brady became a super bowl champ, but in high school they didn't even give him a chance.","I know, I bet they feel a little stupid now seeing what he has become.","Yes I think so. I wonder if Peterson wants to win such an award before he has to retire.

I was surprised that the Patriots lost the Super Bowl last year.

Funny!","That is funny, I don't care for patriots but can't help but like Brady, a Michigan man go blue!!","Exactly. You cannot fault his tremendous commitment to the game. I think a Bears\/Patriots superbowl would be fun again.","I've read that Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team in high school, that could be interesting!","Yes. That is probably a pretty vivid and inspiring song!","I was also interested to read about the Lions' coach is a rocket scientist! Have you seen him during a game? So rough looking","Matt Patricia?

Also interesting is that they embed chips in the should pads to track the players every move","I had heard that somewhere. Plus all of the wonderful new technology in the helmets to help with the concussion problem.","Yes that is a scary thing!","Seems to be getting worse, despite the tech advances. Players must be stronger, bigger and faster?","Definitely, so many people can be so competitive it gets scary.","Yes. Hey do you know the highest score ever in a football game? You'll never guess!","I have no idea, but would guess maybe 77?","Good try! In 1916, it was 222-0. Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland.

I can't believe there's only one left handed QB in the NFL and that's Kellan Moore. I figured there'd be far more left handers!","I've never actually noticed but it just seems like there should be. Maybe there will be more quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes. I think he can throw with either hand.","Maybe so! I wonder if the deaf guy named Paul. D. Hubbard who created the circular huddles used today to keep opposing teams from reading his hand signals was left handed?","I don't know. I think it's neat that there used to be a deaf quarterback and I wonder why there's none in current times. The huddle is a smart way to protect his conversations though!","Indeed it is.

I wonder why he just wouldn't give the backup a chance when clearly the starter was not doing so good.","It's a mystery, isn't it. But coaches sometimes make back decisions. I tell you what I often wonder is why we haven't had a female player drafted yet. Females are allowed to play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements, believe it or not!","I guess they haven't tried or been able to meet requirements. I've seen a few female players, mostly kickers, on the news and other shows. I know there is a female ref and I think an assistant coach of some kind now.","Is there really? I mean, since the average game is only 11 minutes in terms of live gameplay, you'd think we would have at least seen a female kicker by now, right?","The nfl is slow moving on some things. Just look at the New Orleans Saints. They have a rule for the cheerleaders that if they are at a restaurant and a player comes in they have to leave.","That is hard to believe and I can't believe lawsuits haven't been filed yet unless it's just some silly voodoo superstition or something? Either way, in terms of money, women would be better off becoming engineers since they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players anyway.","Wow, that really surprises me. I mean, some of these contracts players get are so extreme!","Hey, even crazier, back in the 1960s, the top bowlers made more than the top football players. That is so depressing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is.","I guess people weren't that into football back then like they are now. Now ESPN wins an emmy for creating a yellow line to show where the first down is during the game.","That is true and that yellow line is so innovative. I couldn't watch a game without it today! But thankfully people are more into football today as I couldn't see a bowler making more than Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career. That would be plain wrong!","That would be wrong and I like that line too. It makes the game more intense and exciting when you know just how far a team has to go. Do you watch any college football games?","I do like to watch college football. But I feel sorry for those teams who play Iowa at their stadium and have to sit in a pink lockerroom. I'm not sure if that's good or bad for the University of Iowa. Ha! What about you?","I love college football! I think it's better than the NFL actually.

He took a lot of AP tests in high school and started college as a junior. Smart guy.","Okay, That's nice.","If he doesn't do well in the NFL, I bet he could become an engineer. They make more on average over their careers.","Okay, Last offseason the Redskins traded for Alex Smith, hoping he would fill that hole for several years. But when he suffered the compound spiral fracture of his right leg in November, it left his career in doubt and the Redskins needing to plan for life without him. The Redskins have made it clear that Smith's health, regardless of football, is most important.","It's good to hear that the team is concerned. I think that he needs to consider other alternatives besides football.","What is your favorite team in National Football League?","Probably the Green Bay Packers. They are the only non-profit team in the league. They are worth a ton of money.","I like too.

He can be the next Brady.","That's what I hope will happen. Before becoming the first overall pick in 2005 draft Alex Smith recieved his Bachelors degree in two years. Then he went on to get his masters. I couldn't imagine being a quarterback and doing that much school in that much time.","Sounds like he is not only a great QB but also a really smart person, he received the degree in just 2 years and then his masters, thats incredible","Yeah it is...Did you know that the huddle was started by a deaf quarterback Paul Hubbard.. He did it so the other team couldnt read his signals","He started a legacy, that is a sure thing, do you know who Baker Mayfield is?","No who is he","He is a QB not only talented in the game but also a master video game player, he almost left football to become a pro gamer","Well he can always do that when he retires from football","I guess he can, he will have plenty of time and money to pursue that other dream,","Most definately.. when tom brady was in highschool his coach never started him","Thats ironic, considering Brady is like the best QB in the history of NFL lol"],"emotion":["positive","informed","talented"]},{"dialogue":["Good morning! How are you? I am sad football is over for the season. Are you a fan.","I've not heard of that. I'm only familiar with the 32 NFL teams.","I think it's called the alliance of american football. It started up after the superbowl back in February.","I'm surprised that I've not heard of it. I like that the NFL allows women to play as long as they can meet league requirements.","I think all of the games are shown on the nfl network. I like that too. Maybe someday there will be women on the teams.","I think it would be dangerous for women to play alongside men. I guess the NFL rules are more forward thinking that the rules the Saints have for their cheerleaders.","Perhaps but if a woman can meet the requirements then she would have had to prove herself strong and capable. What kind of rules do the Saints have?","Yes, I guess that is a good point. Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as an NFL player.","Maybe they do that to prevent scandals in the news and such. Keep the players focused on the game?","Maybe, but I think it's extreme to think that if a cheerleader is already at a restaurant and a player comes in she has to get up and leave, even mid-meal.","Well yeah, that is extreme. They should change that to the last person to walk in has to leave regardless of whether they are a player or a cheerleader.","I agree. I can not believe how little actual live game play there is in an average game.","What do you mean?","I guess an average game only has something like 11 minutes of actual game play.","Wow, that is a surprise. I mean, a game lasts three hours and they only actually play for 11 minutes?","I know! An even more interesting fact is that an engineer over a lifetime earns more than an average NFL player.","That is interesting. It really makes you think. Especially when you realize all that goes into a game and player. The NFL spends money to put tracking chips on the players to record their every movement.","Yes, I've heard they put tracking chips in the players shoulder pads. I bet it helps make strategic game plays.","i bet it does too. Then there are chips inside the footballs to record it's movements too. In a way, football is becoming very scientific.","Yes, I agree!

That is so crazy to think only 11 minutes, I wonder what is the other 3 hours lol","A lot of filler and cheerleaders! Fun fact I recently learned about cheerleaders, the Saints forbid their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any of their players.","That isn't too fun, it sounds kind of sexist, what do you think?","It is sexist for sure and wrong. Interestingly enough, the NFL has no rule prohibiting female players!","I'm surprised! I couldn't imagine that happening, but i did hear a female kicker may be the first soon","That would be cool. I know some college teams have had female kickers. Colorado is the biggest school to have I believe.","wow, I did not know that. My team is the Iowa Hawkeyes, they have a pink locker room for visitors","That is some subtle gamesmanship! I actually went to Maryland. Our recent coordinator hire, Matt Canada, had to take over the coaching duties last year.","Yea that was unfortunate on what happened with the player and coach being fired, sad to hear","Yes, a very sad story all around. Canada was pretty good last season. He set school records at Pitt for his offensive production.","Nice, I did not know that. I wonder if benjarvus green ellis played for him in college. He never fumbled once in his football career","That is a crazy stat! It is amazing how far football has come. At one point in the 1960s the top bowlers were making double the top football stars!","That is so crazy, now it pays to be an engineer though, they make more money in their lifetime than most players do","That is shocking! I wonder if some players are actually really smart like Alex Smith. He had so many AP credits, he was able to enroll in college as a high school junior!","That is crazy to think, and he became the first overall pick in 2005, smart man!

Did you know that, when he played JV football, his team didn't win a game or even score a TD, yet his coach never put him, as backup QB, into a game! Think he's come a long way since those days?","Ya he was underappreciated and now he is considered the biggest steal in nfl history","For sure. Prob. the greatest QB, with 6 SB rings to date. Watching his throws is - a thing of beauty. Wonder why fb teams don't huddle much anymore?","Well the huddle initally were created by a deaf QB to prevent other players from seeing his hand signals","That makes sense. Does huddle take too much time?","Not really, but it is kind of like a group cheer too","I see. Am a Big Ten - Penn State - fan. Loved to watch Saquon Barkley, now a RB w\/the NY Giants run. Think he just won Rookie of the Year. Have you seen him?","No, but curious to learn more","Watch 2018 season highlights on YouTube. Barkley is featured. Do you like Patriot's RB, Gronkowski?","I liked Green Ellis more","Okay. Know him, too. Great player! Brady has a lot of choices - really deep offensive line, don't you think?","Ya I mean the QB is the core of any offensive","And its leader.

Must have been hard!","Yea, I wonder if the nfl was able to find out how he did it with the tracking chips they put into player's equipment","I wonder. They also put tracking chips in the football to track its velocity and rotations. Maybe that helps as well.","Possibly, it's amazing how much info they can get when the game only averages 11 minutes of live gameplay","Yeah. I wonder how people do not get bored while watching football.","I don't know, I wonder if that was why top bowlers made twice as much as football players in the 1960s","I wonder how they made so much. Engineers also make more than football players in their lifetimes.","I heard engineers make more than mlb players too, I guess paying attention in school pays off","Yep, although I am guessing that you have to be a veteran engineer to make that much.","I suppose so, I bet cumberland had a team full of engineers when they lost to Georgia tech 222-0","Well, that was back in 1916 but that still must have been a very embarrassing defeat.","Yea, tv wasn't even around back then but now we got yellow first down lines winning emmys","Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL?","That's pretty crazy but not as crazy as deaf quarterback Paul D.

The trends would be hard to predict though","Yeah, so far New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi have participated in it and legalized it and it's also open to NCAA as well as pro sports as well. Seems so risky though!","Definitely! I'd much rather watch the game for enjoyment than bet my money on anything. I went to a few high school games back in the day. Their fight song wasn't nearly as cool as the one Snoop Dogg would have written for his son's team","Yeah, I think I would feel so antsy and suffer from immense tachycardia if I were to place money on the outcome of a game. I wonder if players are paid \"side money\" to throw the ball a certain way or purposefully not catch it when there\\'s sport betting involved.","Probably not, but there may not be a way to find out for sure. Quarterbacks typically make enough to not need side money. I guess it pays to be the leader of the offensive team if you make it to the NFL","Yeah that's true but may not be so true if it was still back in the 60s because top bowlers back then made twice as much as top football stars did! I don't even think bowling gets broadcasted anymore, does it?","It might if you have all the expensive ESPN channels. Football has become a big deal over the decades though, to the point that there's a stadium in Texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build. The most shocking part is that it's a high school stadium","A high school stadium?! It really is true, everything sure is bigger in Texas, even stadiums! ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down for football, I didn't know they created that.","It sure is helpful in watching the games though. They spend $50,000 for the huge American flags at football stadiums. In addition, it takes a lot to lift all 1,100 of the flag","Yeah good point. I wonder when the athletes train at those nice stadiums whether or not their egos are affected. Who's job is it to lift those flags?","I'm not sure. I wonder if all the stadiums have them. Of the largest stadiums, 14 of 25 are for college teams","Oh ok, I didn't realize flags were that expensive! Wonder if they're locked up somewhere each day. I would think that even though the NFL has no written rule against female players, it would be difficult for females to meet the league's physical requirements in order to play.","It would be a risk to get tackled. The only professional football I see girls playing is association football, also known as soccer","Yeah! I think there might be a lot of controversy surrounding that if females had played but considering that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the lifetime earnings of an nfl player, it might not be worth the risk afterall","Engineering is another field that has a sparse number of women (pun intended). Have you ever heard of the quarterback Brad Johnson?","Lol, that's a great observation! No, I'm not familiar with Brad Johnson, what is he known for besides being a quarterback?","Not only did he win the Super Bowl, but he's also the only quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself","Oh wow! That's an amazing feat! I don't think even Tom Brady has one of those under his belt.","No, but he does have six Super Bowl rings.

That seems like a good weapon!","Yeah, he's really young and really good. I hope he can stay healthy. The article I read recently was dated but it correctly picked the Rams as SUperbowl favorites.","Didn't the Pats win the super bowl?","Yes, that's right. Doh! The Rams lost 3-13.

The NFL's actually the highest professional level of American football in the world, I don't think I've ever heard of them drafting players from other countries like they do for other sports.","That is true. did you know about thet rule that applies to new orleans cheerleaders?","No, what's the rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders?","they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players","what?! there seems to be some gender disparity treatment with that rule. I think they should revisit that rule and change it, I wonder why that is, do you know?","I have no idea but the worst part is of the cheerleader is eatingn they have to get up and leave","That's a little overboard, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is something wrong with that rule. Speaking of rocket scientist, Matt Patricia who is a coach in the NFL was actually a rock scientist before he started coaching for the NFL!","that is soo cool. good for her. the university of iowa's locker room is pink. i wonder why though","To remind the players to be tough and play tough! I don't know, I'm just taking a wild guess since the NFL uses tracking chips to record the players every move on the field.","I have no idea. do you know who benjarvus green-ellis is?","No who is that? That is an odd first name though, I wonder if his nickname is Ben or something because that is definitely not a common first name!","he is a former rb who never fumbled in his nfl career","Never fumbled?

He is incredibly exciting and it's nice to see new young talent injected into the league. Aaron Rodgers is also very fun to watch, but unfortunately, I think his best may be behind him. How about you? Any favorite teams or players?","I do not have any favorites per say since I am not a regular fan but I was reading that women can also play if they can qualify","Absolutely! There are no rules that prevent women from being in the NFL. Do you think a woman will ever play in the NFL?","I do not know we just might have to wait and see if any of them try to make the cut","I think the first time we see a woman play in the NFL will be as a kicker. Kickers don't have to tackle and take hits like the rest of football players do. However, I could see a very strong woman actually attempt to play a different position.","Yeah me too, why not, there are very tough women out there.

I will admit, the NFL is an extremely poor run \"organization.\" Lots of corruption, dishonesty, and unethical behavior. Teams, such as the New Orleans Saints are also pretty unethical.","I really have no idea. And the worst is, if the players walk in and they cheerleaders are eating, they have to leave","That is very degrading to the cheerleaders. It's not like there are safety concerns or anything... They're in a public place. I can understand they not wanting the players and cheerleaders alone together, but it seems like there is a very small chance of something bad happening. Seems like the players just have a superiority complex.","Yeah for sure. Do you know how mych game play time there is in a game of football","If I remember correctly, each quarter is 15 minutes long and there are 4 quarters to a game. Did you watch any of the Super Bowl last week?","Yeah and apparently out of all that, there is only 11 minutes of active game play","Yeah, it's pretty pathetic, haha. There is a couple seconds of action and then several minutes of standing around. It can still be very exciting at times though; much more than some other sports. Baseball is pretty bad with a lack of action and lots of standing around.","Yes, very true. Did you know nfl players make less money than engineers?","Good, they don't deserve to make as much as engineers. Engineers actually do something productive for society.

If they are already eating and players walk in they have to leave. That must be an old time rule.","It isn't that out of the ordinary of a policy, the redskins have the same one.","I don't know it just doesn't seem fair, but what is cool is that there is no law prohibiting a woman from playing in the NFL if she meets requirements.","Yeah, there were players in high school. I wonder how people would react though if one got injured very badly.","And I am left handed and I find it pretty cool that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.","Yeah, that surprised me that there is only one left handed qb in the NFL.","Hey it makes him unique and makes him stand out","Yeah, I wonder if it is due to the offense having to adjust.","Some football stuff I find funny, like the university of Iowa's visiting locker room being pink. They must hate being in there","Yeah, some it is funny. I think they do that to intimidate the opposing team.","They probably do. And did you know that Benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a ball in his NFL career. That is awesome.","WOW! No I didn't. He must have glue for hands!","He must be hated by the opposing team for sure.","I'm sure they've taken note of him.

I try to watch it all. How about you?","I watch it sometimes. I'm very interested though in the Super Bowl mostly, and also do you think that we will ever see a female player in the NFL?","Who knows honestly? Perhaps one day we will. After all, the league has come a long way since the first playoff game that was played on an 80 yard long dirt field inside of Chicago Stadium back in 1932!","That's crazy that's how they started!

But I guess with the tracking chips they stick in the players' shoulder pads to record their every moves, it's really less to record, I suppose!","Yes those chips are interesting, they can actually track things like player speed and location, do you think they put tracking chips on the New Orleans cheerleaders?","Ha! I honestly don't know! So do you like football in general? Like high school football as well? There's a stadium in Allen, Texas that actually seats 18k and cost $60 million to construct... And it's a high school stadium. Can you believe that?","I know that seems weird to me, I don't know why a high school football team needs such an expensive Stadium, do you know any Engineers by the way? On average they will make more their lifetime than an NFL player","That's surprising really! I guess it's due to engineers having longer careers, maybe. But I do know the highest paid over all US Department of Defense employees are football coaches of three service branch teams!","Yes those coaches make a lot of money! What do you think about the team that painted their opposing team's locker room paint? You think that helped them out in the game","Maybe so? Ha! I also wonder if those massive US flags hanging at football stadiums that weighs over 1,100 pounds and costs $50k to make are a help as well!","Yeah those seem huge! also huge is the difference between what professional bowlers make now and what professional football players make now, and that used to be reversed in the 60's where the bowlers would make twice as much as a football player","That is sad. I wonder why that was? I guess today, football is a more popular sport than bowling since 14 of the world's 25 biggest stadiums are all football stadiums in the US!","Yes I think it depends on how good the players are, in terms of how popular it is, for instance I really like the Patriots and they have a running back who has never fumbled the ball before, that's amazing","Really? That's almost as unbelievable as hearing Kellan Moore is the only quarterback who's left handed in the league!","That is unbelievable! I wonder if it gives him an advantage or not, I also love Baker Mayfield, he was almost a professional video game player kind of like me haha","Wow! Ha! I'm sure he made the right choice, at least in terms of money for now! Speaking of quarterbacks, did you know Brad Johnson is the only QB in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself?

Will that hurt them?","Well, that is a good point so I don't know. Adrian Peterson has been a huge playmaker for them.","Alex smith has 48 rushing yards. Is he a good running back?","Alex Smith is the quarterback for the Redskins. He is a great player and can throw some bombs but then at other times be sort of a let down.","Is that because of the runn pass option?

HA!","It sounds like Smith ran with Kansas City last year too. Why did he switch teams?","Ya never really know the truth about why people switch teams but comes down to performance I would guess. Washington has deployed a read-option look with Smith 16 times this season so he is a good fit for this team.","Is he the same Alex Smith that took a ton of AP classes and started college as a Junior?","Yep, that's him!

Nice chatting with you"],"emotion":["conversational","positive"]},{"dialogue":["hey there, do you watch NFL?","Part of it, how about you?","Yeah I kind of fell asleep at the end, but I woke up and saw I had won some money so I was happy. Do you have a favorite NFL team?","I do not have a favorite one. How about you? I like that they have no rule against woman who can also play in the NFL?","Yeah I think that is super cool, I really want a female player to make a team and play and the field soon. I think it would be so great for all the young girls into sports. And I follow the Packers.","Yeah, I mean even the locker room for university of iowa players was pink.","Yeah isn't that hilarious. I wonder how they got the ok for that to get painted in the first place.","Yeah I wonder too. in the sixties top bowlers made twise as much as football players.","That is so funny, oh if I could have a choice to do it again, I would be a top bowler in the 60's. I would have the life then.","Yes so true. Did you know that ESPN once won an emmy?","Yeah I heard they won it years back when they came out with the yellow line shown for the first down line.","That is so interesting. The highest score in football was scored when gerogia defeated cumberland.","Wasn't it a crazy score of over 200-0? I think I read about that one time.","Yeah that is truly crazy. A former patriots rb never fubled the football in his nfl career.","I heard that. What was his name, I don't remember but know he played for the Patriots.","His name was Benjarvus Green-Ellis. Pretty interesting.","Yeah that is amazing. Do you know when the first NFL playoff game was held?","No I do not know that. Do you?","It was way back in 1932! In Chicago stadium, and the field was basically dirt and only 80 yards long. It was the same place the blackhawks played!","Oh wow it has been around for so long. It was nice chatting with you."],"emotion":["content","informative","positive"]},{"dialogue":["Are you watching the Superbowl this year? wouldnt it be interesting to see a woman play for either team.","Yeah I just found about that though I dont we will ever see one at a pro level, I also didnt know the average game play is 11 minutes","I didn't know that either. Next game i'm going to watch to see if that is true. I do know, though, that there is only 16 regular season games.","Really only 16 thought there were more games, so anyway whats your favorite football position?","Well, there is if you count playoffs and preseason. Oh, and each time has a bye week. My favorite position is either quarterback or wide receiver. You?","Mine is runningback, its been my favorite since I saw Benjarvus Green-Ellis play, so much talent.","I've never heard of him. I'm old school and have to admit that my favorite running back was Tony Dorsett back in the day. But now, as far as talent goes, there's some good players out there. Baker Mayfield for example. He's so talented at stuff he could even do professional video game playing!","Yeah I know who Mayfield is, he is talented I heard he was pretty good at halo back in college.","Yep. I like multifaceted players. Alex Smith for example is reported to be very smart. He was working on a master's degree before being drafted.","Wow, I guess he is one of the few football players with a masters degree, that is admirable.","I think so too. Football can be inspiring like that. I mean, Tom Brady was a second string quarterback in high school and now look!","I bet his coach didnt think he would get so far, his been in almost every superbowl since 2002","I agree. I wonder what will happen with the Patriots when he retires. The quarterback is the leader of the team and they don't seem to have a good replacement in place.","I know, the QB is so influential that he touches the ball in every play, they are going to have a hard time finding a good replacement, not sure how the second string QB is right now.","Knowing that, teams need really good quarterbacks. Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed one?","I didnt know that, football sure is a nice sport, there are many crazy stats like the one in which Georgia Tech defeated another team by 222 points","That is crazy! I would have loved to see that game! I bet neither team had any defense at all!","Yeah, or the other team was probably full with blind people.","Maybe the home team should have tried to psych their opponent out like the University of Iowa does.

I love the game of football, although I find it odd that the NFL has no written rule against female players.","Theres no written rule really? I wonder if well ever see a female player then","Well, we might. As long as a female can meet league eligibility requirements, she is free to play.","Great maybe some day, did you hear about those tracking chips the NFL use? amazing how much the game has grown over the years","Yes, I've heard the NFL uses the chips in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field.","I think thats intersting, they use it to track their position and then they also place the chips on the footballs and all kids of interesting stats are pulled from them","Well then I guess they can really hold the players accountable for how they are playing and also make some really good plans too.","I agree so did you hear about the rule the Saints have against cheerleaders in their team?","Yes! It sounds completely sexist to me. I can not imagine being at a place eating as a cheerleader, having a player walk in, and having to get up and leave without finishing my meal!","I kwow right, having to walk away would be humiliating specially if you are with friends and family, humiliating and totally unfair","I agree. Seems dated. Can you believe that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL player?","That actually make sense, most players have a carreer of 20 years and then enginneers work for 40 years or even more","Well, yes. I'm not sure which career I'd like better. It would be nice to have the NFL perks, that's for sure.","Yeah but then theres are all the injuries associated with the game and the brain damage","Well, yeah, that is a drawback. Even top bowlers in the 1960's made twice as much as top football stars. I think I'd rather bowl!","I like bowling, it seems like a safer game not a lot of room for injuries, well Bowlers make a lot less now","Yes. I'm sure they still make better money than a 9-5 though. They have to be talented though. Like former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the FB in his NFL career!","I have to google that like right now, he never flumbled the ball? wow, anyways its been great chatting with you I feel lot smarter now","No, never in his career!

Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell gone in a year?","That's what I am thinking about, but that always been my team, they do need better players, they seems to fall everytime against a good team like New England.","True, JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Conner are both special players too, even if they only play for 11 minutes throughout the game.","Do you actually believe that a four quarter game only 11 minutes of live plays?","I could maybe see that, I thought it'd be a lot less to be honest. If we're just talking about from snap to whistle. What do you think?","I would say no way, Including quarterback time, run time, field goal time, It almost takes the average person 11 minutes to enjoy a nice dinner' just my opinion.","Haha for sure, I think it's just between the whistles though right. Like a FG would start when the ball is snapped and end when the whistle is blown, so like 5 seconds? It'd be interesting to see the way they came up with that stat.","I would agree with that, what do you think about women in the nfl, do you think the ratings will drop to a low?","Not sure, if they can keep up that would be cool to see, I just don't see it happening anytime soon, what do you think?","I am not trying to be negative, but I don't see it either, because It would be hard to find a 250 to 300lbs player hitting a woman head on, I can't see that happening.","True, maybe as a kicker or punter sometime? I don't know who would really want to play in the NFL anyways. Alex Smith is pretty smart too, took a lot of AP tests in High School","That's true, I would be upset if I play the nfl pool and a player let another player run by and make a touch down just because she's a woman.","True, I could see that. How much did Juniperro Serria HS regret not playing Tom Brady?","Wow, I bet he still regret it, did you know in 1961 georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0? I never heard of cumberland, have you?","I have not, they're in Georgia though I'd assume right? They probably shut down the school after that game haha.","Hahaha, they probably did, because I pretty sure they most have fired the coach.

The Junipero Serra High School had such a bad year they failed to even score a touchdown.","I think I've heard of them before. During that year wasn't their starting quarterback tom brady?","Actually, he was their backup. They never played him!","That's right! He was the backup. He's been a starter for so long now I just automatically said it lol! Have you heard of baker mayfield before?","Yeah, I have heard the name but I don't know much about him.","He was the starting quarterback for the university of oklahoma.

Isn't he a professional quarterback too?","Yes, and he's smart. He earned his Bachelor's degree in 2 years and got his Masters before becoming the first pick in 2005 draft","Wow! That is impressive! Good for him! He must have worked very hard in school. I mean, quarterbacks touch the ball for practically every offensive play so you know he was busy with football and to still do so great academically is fantastic.","No doubt! I wonder if he every played Iowa in college. Their visitor's locker room is pink!","That's funny. I guess that school has a good sense of humor. Speaking of schools, have you heard of Georgia Tech?","I have heard of them. I'm guessing they have a good team?","Not sure if they do now, but back in 1916 they did. They scored the most points ever in a game. They beat Cumberland 222-0.","Wow, that's quite a thumping! Could you imagine being on the losing side of that game?","I would feel awful. That bad of a beating would probably make me highly consider quitting playing. I can't help but wonder though why they just didn't call the game at some point.","I totally agree. Great chat!

We don't have any of the 16 teams from the NFC or AFC in my state unfortunately","ahh, I'm from Long Island NY, so I guess we're neighbors ;)","I wonder if European Football uses tracking chips like how the NFL embeds them into shoulder pads","Yeah I don't think so ;) I mean, I've never heard about that. I wonder what's the point...","I guess the NFL uses them to track the players movements and they also have them in the ball to track velocity, rotation, speed, and location","Holy crap, so much data for running with the ball and passing it from time to time... :) Hey I heard that the highest score in football was 222-0 ? Is that really high ?","Usually in the pros once you break into the 40s its consider really high, in College there will be a game once in a while that breaks into the 60's or 70s","what... so how the hell did they do that ? 222 ? That's like 4 times bigger score than that...","Yea, It must of been the best team in College football at the time facing another college that's team had the skill equivalent of a high school team","Are matches like that entertaining to watch ? Soccer matches are really exciting even with score 0-0","If the games are close in score they tend to fun to watch, if it's one-sided and you're not a fan of the high scoring team then no, that's why I don't really like college football 90% of the games aren't competitive","I see... In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars - was bowling that popular in USA ?","Not really, back in the 60s football wasn't as popular and there was no unions, players during the offseason worked regular job","ahh, ok... hey what's up with those pink locker rooms in university of iowa's ? Did You hear about that ?","Head games I guess. Did you know 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams?","Probably huge budget stands behind it...

Although not as much as an engineer!","I guess if they take all the players that only play one or two years into that average, I do believe engineers in fact make more in their lifetime!","Yes that is very surprising, it must be because the NFL players career is so short.

He didn't want the other team to read his hand signals.","I wonder if any of the hand signals have an signifigance in ASL since there are deaf and hard of hearing players on the teams.","That's a good point. In the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football stars. Still, I wonder how much bowlers made overall. Was it that much money?","I think back then the players in the NFL weren't getting the exorbident sums they are now. Given all the injuries they sustain though I think the pay is mostly justified.","On a per-minute basis, they make a great wage. There is only 11 minutes of action on average.","That has to be without the huddles and hikes and all that because there is a clock that ticks down. I think it must be 11 minutes of actual moving.","Did you know that there is only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL? Kellan Moore. I expected more, considering how many lefty pitchers there are in the MLB.","I didn't know that. I wonder if it is because of the way the ball is thrown and caught. It seems like it would be harder to do lefthanded than with say a baseball.","I wonder if the plays have to be reworked for a lefty. The receiver routes and such","I would imagine so. It is hard to catch things from a lefty. Everything is always just a bit off.","The NFL has no rules against women playing. I think that women could play at certain positions, like kicker. Women would probably draw a lot of interest, perhaps increase the TV audience.","If a woman is kicker does she still have to meet the same requirements as the other players?","I suppose there is a lot of competition for kicker, so it would be tough. Plus there is no feeder system like for men. Women soccer players might qualify.","I would think that when it comes to kickers there would be more crossover between football and soccer.

I know that I really like Tom Brady personally","Tom Brady will go down as one of the best, if not the best. I was always a big Brett Favre fan.","Oh I agree with you! I think a lot of quarterbacks are actually really talented, like Alex Smith, he passed out of a lot of classes in college because he did so well on the APs","Yeah it sounds like Alex Smith could have gone into plenty of different fields if he didn't choose football.","Yeah I agree, he almost got a master's degree before he went into the draft, what do you think about the circular huddle? Did you know it was invented by a deaf quarterback?","I think that is one of the most interesting and coolest facts about pro football!","Yeah I agree with you, I used to play a lot of video games in college and apparently Baker Mayfield was almost a professional video game player, I didn't know that.","I didn't know that either, I think he is really good at one game in particular as well, do you know which one?","Yeah it was Halo 3. I was actually also good at that game haha. If only we went to the same College I could have played him, maybe I should have been a professional videogame player LOL","That is hilarious, I used to play a lot of Halo 1 and 2 back when I was in college. Ohhhh Halo 2 and Milwaukee's best light beer. lol","Haha yes those were the days! I was the best at Halo 1 and Halo 2, but I did play Halo 3, I actually did win some tournaments for Halo 1. What would you think if you entered a locker room and it was painted pink btw?","That must have been really fun to play in those. Yeah I think I have heard that before, that is hilarious!","Yeah if it's at the University of Iowa, they painted the opposing team's locker room pink. I wonder if that increase or decrease their winning percentage afterwards though? It would make me play harder","That is a very good question, and I want to know who gave the final ok for them to do that!","What other games are you good at? Are you good at bowling at all? They used to make more than professional football players back in the 60s","I can bowl a little bit, but that just goes to show how far the NFL has come since then!","I agree! do you ever watch football on TV?

Im not really into it either. this is interesting though: Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.","Wow! That I was unaware of. Although it makes sense as technology can help figure out what they need to work on. Probably why they get paid so much but apparently an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a pro baller.","wow, that is crazy considering football players are pretty much putting their health and safety at risk all the time.","I know. Kind of funny that its the quarterback that gets the most attention when the others seem to put more wear and tear on their bodies.","Right! Except this, its pretty impressive: Superbowl winning quarterback, brad johnson, is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass... to himself.","How is that even possible? I just found out that the huddle was created because a deaf quarterback could give hand signals without the other team seeing. Personally I am more impressed that he is deaf. \\\\","Thats insane. But thats nice that the nfl was willing to make a huddle to accomodate that player!","Yeah, that was pretty cool of them. Do you watch any college ball?","not at all! I only watch the 49ers games and the Superbowl. But really I know nothing about the game, I just cheer when I hear \"touchdown\"","Yeah, I dont either. I read once that NFL cheerleaders dont get paid by the NFL although Im not sure how true that is.","Right, they dont even get paid for expenses for traveling to the game, I think. They get paid from some cheerleading organization. I knew a cheerleading coach. That seems hard as a career.","Apparently New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are forbidden to be seen eating in the same restaurant as a player and if a player comes in a restaurant they are eating at, the cheerleader has to leave. That seems rude to me.","Wow, whats the deal with that? I thought we were past segregation. lol","LOL! I know, right? I actually was at a Dennys once when a Saints player came in with his agent after a game. Didnt see any cheerleaders though and to be honest, wasnt all that impressed.","Did you know, Those humongous american flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make. Really?

Which got me wondering why I hadn't seen any female football players did you know there are currently no written rules against female players in the NFL.","I think that violence against women would be an queer spectator sport, even in America. Is there a sport with violence against the women?","Um, no I don't think so, but did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplay?","Thats scandalous. Therre should be some sort of law about minimal work time or something.","Yes, It makes me ponder how much times have changed. Back in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.","How much money was that exactly? I dont think either of them groups made much. I guess the bowlers got all the women and the glory though. They were graceful ahtletes.","Im not sure, but yes there seems to be a lot of irregularities within the sport for instance New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to be in the same restaurants as any of the players.","I think thats a sexist form of misogyny or seomething along those lines. The men should be chivalrous and leave the women.","To each their own I suppose, speaking of lines, That super imposed yellow line you see in the game, ESPN has won an emmy for that. Did know that was possible.","I think ESPN should try to put a line where the cheerleaders are so that they dont have problems with players. That would be chivalrous of ESPN. What does ESPN stand for?","I think people should just have some common sense but I don't see that happening anytime soon. The NFL uses tracking devices to track players on the field, im sure that a way to keep tabs on players","I think they could track them off the field too. Too many of them guys get into all kinds of criminal mischief. They need some help.","in that case the whole world would be tracked, I think we can think of better ways than to \"control\"","NFL players are role models for many young people. I am not. I cannot speak for you. I figure that if they don't get into trouble, they dont need tracking. But some of them,.. I dunno.","Thats a whole other subject we dont have enough time here for. but this would be a whole different place if more Love was implemented the current system has people going crazy and violence is out of hand, we must look within oneself.","I suppose that we are running out of time. The NFL should invent a chip to help up look within ourselves not just track each other. What is inside? Chips might just help us there.","I disagree, we have everything we need to look within ourself... you would just be giving YOUR power away by allowing to get chipped. Someone else in control of you and your decision. This plante would no longer be free will. The NFL should just stick with tracking balls to track speed and rotation","I feel lost sometimes and am willing to try the chips. I trust the science of the soul. Anyway, thanks for the heart to heart chat.

He convinced everyone he is Superman, that is his nickname.","so he is past his peak. didnt his team play in the superbowl recently? i think i remember they lost.","They based everything on a guy who cant hold his temper. He acts out when he cant throw and blames others.","so much of the game's success depends on personality and integrity. cant teach that. either you got it or you dont.","Yep, I agree with you. Some people like Cam are not ready for the long career. Turner began to take the pressure off Cam by scheming more throws to the running backs.","you gotta work with the players you have, not the ones you want. the NFL is an interesting study in personality. i wonder how women would fare in the nfl.","Yeah, good question. Ya know the NFL does not have a rule against women playing.","ive heard as much. i figure if a woman could do the job, theyd hire her. i just dont think it will happen.","I think anything is possible but no women have met the leagues eligibility requirements yet.

It usually takes four years.","Yeah, he really was bright and focused. More students should do that and get through faster. Anyway, great chat!","I know and I agree with the fact that the players need to focus on education and football.

They rarely get tackled and have rules protecting how hard they can get hit. I still feel that a very strong woman could play another position and tackle just as well as the men could.","I hope so.

Hopefully he will stay in Denver long enough to make it on the field.","Or maybe Denver will use Keenum to groom a new young quarterback.","That could happen. The Orange could use Matt Patricia as coach, the only rocket scientist in the NFL.","Yes, the NFL takes all kinds. There are no rules against women playing.","Yeah. If Patricia writes the plays, he takes inspiration from his old RPI fight song, where they mention such football-savvy terms as Sine, cosine, and tangent.","Maybe Patricia should have stuck with rocket science. Engineers earn more lifetime than the average NFL player.","Yeah, and if you have a bad record, it lives in statistical infamy forever. Like the poor Cleveland Browns.

From quarterback to professional gamer... sign me up!","Yes absolutely! He definitely made the right choice going into the NFL, do you know how ESPN won an Emmy though?","No! That's awesome.

I wish that we had video cameras to record it back then, or at least ESPN could have put the yellow line for the first down marker when they were recording that game, maybe it would have helped Cumberland to win haha","Maybe an all-pink locker room (Just like The University of Iowa has!) would have been their good luck charm?","Yeah that's possible!

He received his bachelors degree in two years.","that is quite fast. he must be a good student. is he still playing in the NFL?","Yes that is very fast. It usually takes four years.

He probably won't garner much interest, because he's very injury prone..","True, since he injured his achilles.","Plus his sack numbers were down. He use to be good when he played for the New Orleans Saints, but I think his best days are behind him.","Well, he seemed overwhelmed from the start.","His current team really cut his playing time, which according to him, limits his opportunity to sack the quarterback.","And his fans are rooting for him to go back to the Redskins, however, that is not easy.","Junior Galette has had a slew off trouble off the field. He was even accused of domestic violence.","I think from there, he slowly went downhill.","Plus, there are a lot better young players on the Redskins, namely Ryan Anderson.","That is true, but it is sad for Galette to see the reality of his consequences that were caused from his past.","Hopefully if he stays with the Redskins he can return to his former glory. He did rank third on the team in quarterback pressures.","He needs to step up his game. Get more training and keep his head up.","There is a loyal fan base in Washington, I'm sure everyone wants to see him do better next season.","I agree.

I do know about Alex Smith, he's actually really smart and almost got his master's degree, he even got his bachelor's and only two years before he was drafted","Alex Smith is an awesome guy. Did you know Russell Wilson is still under an MLB contract?","No I didn't know that, how do you think that works? Would they actually try to use him? I like football a lot more than MLB anyway","Not too sure how that works. I don't think they would actually use him.","Well that's good. I wonder if the NFL would ever use a female player? Do you think that will happen in our lifetime","I saw they don't have a written rule against it. I bet we will see a female kicker before long.","Yes I could see that. I just don't know that an NFL game only lasts 11 minutes of Live gameplay, you'd think that it would last longer because it can take up to two hours on TV","That is crazy it is only 11 minutes of gameplay.","Well that is crazy. But also crazy is the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player, it's lower than the average earnings of a engineer. Now that is crazy haha","That is very crazy. I would have never guessed that.","I would have not guessed that cheerleaders would have to leave a restaurant if an actual player from their team came in. Did you hear about the New Orleans Saints? And the cheerleaders for them?","That's interesting. I heard many teams have rules around players and cheerleaders.","Rules seem unnecessary but I also don't play football haha, I wonder if there's a rule against painting a locker room pink for instance","LOL I wonder if that works?","I wonder that too!

Why an engineer?","they make good money over the long haul. plus fewer concussions. LOL","Exactly! I can run, but couldnt take a hit! Do you have a favorite team","at the moment, no. I usually just root for the underdog in the superbowl. i like to see upsets.","Me too. I wish I could have seen the RAms win this year.","The Rams had a great team, but it is hard to beat Tom, Bill and the gang.","It was a boring game because both teams played defense quite well.","yeah, a defensive battle is not a crowd pleaser. people want touchdowns.","Yea, like when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0 for the highest score recorded in a game.","what was going through the coachs head then? that is a horrible thing to do to another team?","Might not be completely intentional. Happened in a game here in the upper Midwest - like 80+ points for one team. Happens when one team gets all the right bounces.","true, but the coach should put in the third string or something. even the cheerleaders maybe.","Could be fun to watch for some.

It is value based on audience. The NFL has the eyeballs now. I do love that yellow line that ESPN added to football broadcasts.","ya that's interesting, I also like that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback, I wonder how he would call an audible if he was deaf though?","He would call the audible by talking. Only he would not hear it. ESPN got an Emmy for that yellow line.","ah that makes sense I guess, I don't like the nfl personally, it doesn't surprise me that there are only about 11 minutes of actual gameply in the average game, I think it is pretty boring","I agree. I greatly prefer college ball with many more plays. The global family of games called football all have some way to score involving kicking. It is pretty minor in US football I think.","Yes that is true, also surprising is that in the nfl there is no written rule against female football players, and that women could play if they met the league's requirements","Wouldn't you be embarrassed to be the coach of a JV team. never win, never score, have Tom Brady as you back-up QB and never let him play?","yeah that would be embarrassing, also its crazy that on average an engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average nfl player, I wonder if its because of the injuries they can get","It is just a short career. The average running back lasts 4 years. The QBs today make a lot though. Imagine if Baker Mayfield had quit football to be a gamer. He would not have been cashing the big checks that he does today.","Ah interesting, that is true, I saw that Baker was the Halo 3 champion of his college, I was really good at halo 1 and 2 I won a lot of tournaments when I was younger, did you ever play games?","Never played Halo, but I went to Oklahoma University so I watched every college game he played. Alex Smith took so many AP tests that he entered college as a junior. My grandson is taking a lot which will save his parents money.","ah that is good, I took 4 ap tests when I went to college and passed all of them, so I saved money, still have some student loans but it is more managable than it otherwise would be haha","Do you play NFL fantasy football. You play 17 weeks from Sept to Dec even though each team only plays 16 games.","no I don't play that, I have friends who do and they always lose money haha. I did see that there is political fantasy that you can play, on whether each side passes certain bills and such, that's probably more to my liking because I follow politics more than football","It is hard to be an optimist when one follows politics closely. We are so polarized. I would not mind giving political fantasy a try.","Yes I agree, it is bad because it can make you depressed but unfortunately it interests me and has an actual affect on my life, so I pay attention to it, do you play fantasy football?","No. But my grown son plays in 5 leagues and makes between $500 and $800 each year.","well that is impressive, I know there is luck but apparently skill if he can win that consistently, anyway great talking with you!"],"emotion":["positive","interested","happy"]},{"dialogue":["Hi, how are you?","I don't know much about football, though I've heard some things.

Touches the ball on every play?","Exactly. But you see, the main quarterback for the Buccaneers didn't get much chance to play against the Bears, and that led to their disaster! Makes me so upset.","That's too bad. Who are the big name QBs in the league now?","I'd say the best has to be Tom Brady. But did you know that his high school team never even let him play!?","What? That's strange. How did he get to play in college then? I thought you had to be a star to do that.","I have no idea. But I think the Buccaneers' defensive coordinator Mike Smith needs to go back to college! He let Tampa score six touchdowns against them! So dumb!","Well, that should be the end of his job. There are plenty of high school jobs out there I'm sure. Maybe he could coach a girl's team.","Ha ha, true. And oops, I meant he let the Bears score six touchdowns, my bad. My anger got me flustered there ha ha.","The nfl has no written rule against female players. Do you think we'll ever see women players?","We could! Maybe one or two in the future. If they ever play against the university of Iowa then I'm sure they'll appreciate the pink locker room there!","I guess maybe the Bucs defensive guy would suffer from Pink lockerroom syndrome or something.","Some kind of syndrome, that's for sure. They've got a lot of issues. One of their players, Winston, was even accused of groping a woman a few years back. Sad state they're in.","I don't understand the need for that behavior. Maybe that's why NO Saints have a rule about cheerleaders with players.","Yeah, maybe that's why that weird rule exists ha ha! Do you think they actually force the cheerleaders to leave when a player walks in the restaurant?","I have to wonder what the consequences are. The players might get fined, or the cheerleaders fired, or something. I don't know. It seems sexist.","Very sexist, indeed.

He is in charge.","I wonder how hard it is for kellan moore as a lefty","Yes he is the only left handed quarterback.

That is brilliant I think!","I wonder what paul hubbard's performance was like though","I am not sure. Probably better than the other quarterback in Tom Brady's high school.

I guess it was an innovation at the time though and certainly made it easier for the fans at home to see the details of the play.","Oh yeah, but at least it shows there's more interest in the sport now. I don't think it would have ever happened back in the 1960s, when even the top bowlers earned more than football stars.","I think a lot of that at the time had to do with how long the career was too. A bowler can play for a much longer time than a footballer due to all those injuries they sustain.","Ahh that's very fair. At the same time, I'd think individual players are more profitable in football. Like quarterbacks, they can be very unique, which I'm sure earns more in endorsement opportunities.","I've always thought that the QB is overrated. I know that he calls a lot of the shots and throws but it seems like the receivers and even the defensive line do most of the work.","That's an argument to be made. Sometimes I even feel quarterbacks have their mind outside of the game.

How the heck two teams like that could even meet on the field ? Totally different level...","Yeah, that or the other team was blind, apparently both teams were at college level.","There had to be some kind of a bet behind the scenes :) a dare or something like that ;)","Definetely, I would retire from football after a loss like that one lol, kind of like the Brazilean soccer team in the 2014 World Cup, just a total humiliation.","Yeah, but that was Brazil... kids there re being born with soccer balls stuck to their feet... quite a humiliation :)","I know and in their own turf."],"emotion":["positive","friendly","negative","passionate","excited"]},{"dialogue":["hey did you know the nfl actually allows for female players?","ya assuming that they met the requirements, I think that'd be interesting and I could see it happening for sure","Well, think about it, in high school, they opened football to both genders.","ya, I don't personally watch sports but it is interesting, also it doesn't surprise me that on average an NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual game play, I personally think football is pretty boring","The only sport I watch and enjoy the most is basketball.

Definitely the quarterback because they are like the leaders on the field and direct the game, what position do you think?","I also agree on the quarterback since like you said, they do lead the offensive play. Any quarterbacks you are interested in?","Tom Brady, he is a great athlete in my opinion, but there's also only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL, Kellan Moore. I wonder if the plays are adjusted because of that","I think that it would be relatively similar. I think Baker Mayfield is also a great athlete.","What position does he play and why do you think he is a great athlete?","Baker Mayfield plays quarterback for university of oklahoma. I just think he has had a stellar record so far.","Oh wow, you think he will be going to be playing for the NFL? I think he also takes great pride in being a great video gamer as well, which is a fun fact","I also recently read that he is quite good at halo 3.","That's a fun game, maybe it's a great de-stressing technique. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an NFL player, I find it very hard to believe, it seems like those contracts are worth hundreds of millions of dollars","Like you said games are a good way for NFL players to destress considering how much stress they put on their body mentally and physically. It is most likely the star players get a ton, but on average its well average.","Yeah, seems like a very tough and demanding job, physically and mentally. Former patriots running back Ellis has never fumbled a football in his entire career, I wonder if anyone else has a close stat to his.","That is an amazing feat, making Ellis a very reliable running back you can count on, especially for the patriots during his time with them.","Yeah, the Patriots sure do a great job of recruiting the underdogs and turning them into stars","I concur.

For instance Baker Mayfield or Alex Smith?","I like Alex Smith, heard he was super smart too as he finished college in 2 years","Yep he is a genius.

They beat the Cowboys 20-17.","Oh? well, haven't they always hated the cowboys though? great to get a chance to beat them!","Yes, you're right! It seems that Redskins fans dislike the Cowboys.

There is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL.\\\\","It must be hard for him. The world is made for right-handed people.","Sure is. I didn't realize that bowlers made more than football players in the 60's!","Bowling used to be very popular. It's boring to watch, though, but fun to play.","I haven't bowled in a long time! I heard that New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player!","I think that is a ridiculous rule.

NFL cheerleaders for the Saints aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as the players.

Like how they use chips in the players' shoulder pads to track every move on the field.","That's funny they kept chips.

Historically, I liked Archie Manning, but he did not have the level of success on the field that his sons had. What I did not know is that at one time, the NFL had a deaf QB, Paul D. Hubbard.

I was surprised and pleased when I learned that we had a female NFL referee officiating the playoff games. Do you ever think we will have female NFL players?","I don't think so, maybe a whole other division but not in the same league as men's, I think that would be really unfair and actually scary to watch","Probably so, but perhaps a woman will try out since the league rules allow it should she meet the eligibility requirements. Perhaps as a kicker since it is a lower contact position. What are your thoughs on tech in football like the tracking chips the NFL use on shoulder pads and in the ball?","I think that tech is taking over the game and that is great, all kinds of cool stats can be known thanks to that so I think its great, stats such as the moves of players, speed of the ball and many more.","I also think is could be a good training aid, especially for the QB. It could let the QB know the speed and rotation of the throw; after all the best throw is a fast tight spiral. Do you follow collegiate football?","I do follow it, some of the time at least but mostly NFL, kind of makes me angry that games only have 11 minutes of live gameplay.","I am having trouble figuring out where the rest of the time goes. After all, they only 20 seconds to huddle, line up, and snap the ball. I guess if the play lasts less than 20 seconds and results in a dead ball then that could be part of the reason why!","Yeah I guess so still seems like little time, games tend to last a long time and only 11 minutes is unfair to fans.","True. I prefer to watch it live and am a season ticket holder for my alma mater, the LSU Tigers. Did you know that the highest scoring football game was in collegiate with Georgia Tech beating Cumberland 222-0 in 1916?","222-0 !!! is that real? woah, how can a team lose by that many points were they even playing the same sport lol.","What I also find interesting is some of the quirky off-field rules. Like the one forbidding Saints cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as NFL players. Its unfair that they must leave even if they were there first and already eating!","That is really unfair, the NFL should ban that rule and the Saints should change it not only sexist but also humiliating rule, makes me feel angry and disgusted.","It seems so immature! Like the University of Iowa painting the visiting football team's locker room all pink!

I wish I went off to college my junior year in high school but at the rate he was going with his AP tests, its not surprise he would skip 12 grade in high school. The fact that he could balance all of that and football is pretty amazing. He's an athletic genius :)","I agree with you! What do you think about Kellen Moore as well? He's the only left-handed quarterback in the league I wonder if that gives him an advantage or not?","That says a lot, I know that lefty's are highly regarded in general. I think it could give him an advantage since most players may be right handed so he's able to really dodge the other players when passing the ball.

Also, I wonder if the deaf quarterback did research when he invented the circular huddle.

At least he can always brag about not ever fumbling the ball to the grand kids. I'm sure not every football player can say the same. Where is Green-Ellis now? Did he make hall of fame? I hope so!","I hope so too! I don't know that he plays anymore, but I don't really keep up with football that much now. I also think it's crazy how they use tracking chips on the players.

Pretty soon they'll embed a chip in the players body which they should because some of those guys are trouble makers lol I don't follow football much but they seem to make headlines lol I also noticed how much the nfl has advanced in other technological ways with all the angles they are able to get on camera during the games and the wireless microphones that the team coaches and assistants get to wear to track their team more as well.","Yep I could see that. It's kind of scary and hopefully they can take those chips and cameras off once they leave the field. I hope that civilians never have to wear those, because you can track everything from location to speed to Velocity and rotation, it's a changing world that's for sure","Its a little creepy if you think about it.

I am female, though I don't know if I would even want to be a football player. I'd rather be an engineer, as they make more than the average NFL player on average, over a lifetime.","Absolutely. Much less chance of injury! There are some people who can do both - Alex Smith was working on his master's degree when he became the number one pick in the draft.","Yeah, it's cool that he was such a good student and had a backup plan. I wonder if he was on the football team in high school. If he was, how did he find so much time to take so many AP tests that he entered university as a junior?!","That is a good question. Its so funny that Tom Brady was never even allowed to play in high school even though his team never won a game or scored a touchdown!","Haha, that is funny.

Thought contracts were written rules. Sometimes players get franchised or tagged. Fellow players often weigh in on talk shows, too. Did you know Cousins wanted about $30 deal to stay with Redskins?","I did not know that. I saw the average football game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.","Interesting.

The Quarterback? It sounds like a difficult and dangerous job.","Yeah the quarterback, QB is the abbriviation, the are part of every offensive play so yeah, really important job the one they do","The QB should get paid the most then because they have to deal with the ball all the time.It is a heavy burden for one person.","In most teams they are, so Tom Brady, a leyend of the game, used to be bench in his high school team, his team would lose so many game and the coach wouldnt start him","He was not old enough to bear the QB burden. It is hard for one who is young. He needed to age to the right age for carrying the burden of the QB.","Yeah maybe he wasnt good enough back then or he had a terrible coach,","That is a possibility.

Do you know who invented the circular huddle and how it came about?","Yes, I googled it and it was Paul Hubbard in 1892, interesting being deaf. Now the coaches all cover they mouths and huddle to keep the other team from lipreading the signals.

I really wonder why that is, if it serves a purpose or has a reason behind it","Seems like a feminizing act I guess or just a distraction from the game preparation. I thought the New Orleans Satints were a little rough on their cheerleaderes, can't dine with a player and have to leave mid-meal is one shows up at their restaurant, that seems a little one sided and sexist.","I really agree with you there, I do not see a point in that rule at all. THey can play in the game if they qualify and yet cannot eat in the same place as other players.","Maybe it was designed to make it difficult to date? No sense to me. I do travel to europe a lot, funny they consider football what we consider soccer, but I was surprised how many flavor of football there are besides those to, Australian, Gaelic, etc.","Yeah I guess each country has their own concept of what constituted football. The nfl guys do not seem to make much money though.","Less than an engineer on average lifetime, I know. I see where as I mentioned Patrick Mahomas of the Chiefs is set to resign for $200 million, maybe that will bring the average up.","COuld be, I read an article about a nfl player who teaches during the off season to make ends meet","Back when I was in KC they said in the 1960's all the players had summer jobs, like Will Lanier the big linebacker delivered refrigerators.

And now they place chips on their padding to track movements and such.","I read that and wondered about that. I wasn't sure to what end they embedded the chip in the sholder pads, did that make any sense to your, do you see a reason?

They also don't have a rule against tracking their players apparently they use chips embedded in the uniforms to track the players locations on the field","Hmm. Can't they just see them?! ;-) It's amazing some of the technology that's used in games.

Since there are 32 NFL teams, 31 are disappointed every year","31 disappointed and the Patriors is usually the happy 32 team, they win all the time Brady is one of the big reasons","That is true.

I have chatted much in recent days about football. You?","no i didnt have a chance to see the sb. i heard that it was a bit slow.","Yeah it sure was, the first 3 quarters there was no much offense or scoring at all. Not very exciting, not like the year before I will say.","The year before had a big comeback, right?","Yeah the Eagles and the Pats had a good back and forth going, with the Eagles QB making some crazy plays to win the game.","the eagles had not won the sb before, right? that was their first, i think","Yeah good call, it was their first. I think they deserved it and wasn't going to feel sorry for the Pats, since they have dominated the last 10 years or so.","Yeah, brady has six rings now? someone else deserves a turn","I think he does yeah, he will go down as one of the greatest. I was hoping the KC Chiefs would have won it, with their young star QB.","I wonder what is going to happen next year. the NFL needs to deal with the problem of concussions and injury.","They sure do, I hope all of the tracking technology can be used to improve player safety. Did you see the movie Concussion, with Will Smith?","I did not. does he play a doctor or something? there was a nigerian guy doing research on CTE, right?","Yep, he plays a doctor that does extensive research on CTE and a lot of people involved in the league don't want to accept his findings till years later.","Yeah, there is too much money to be made. Player injuries get in the way of that.","Yeah they sure do. Did you know that there is no rule regarding female players in the league?","i heard that. i wonder if a woman will ever show up at tryouts.","I hope so, but I think the system we have in place, well actually we don't have a system in place for girls to work their way up to the pro level.","yeah, there is no high school or college ball for girls. they cant prepare for the pros.","Yep, that is why it will be hard, but once one does, I think it will open the floodgates for all types of women's programs which would be cool.","I would like to see more women in sports. athletics is important for many reasons. Anyway, great chat!","Yeah I agree there, and same to you, I hope you have a good day!"],"emotion":["positive"]},{"dialogue":["Hi! Do you follow the Rams at all? I'm glad Sean McVay became the top candidate for coach of the year. He deserves it after what he's done in his first season with the Rams!","So very true. It's certainly rare to do what he's done - like molding Jared Goff to become a franchise QB and turning Todd Gurley into an MVP candidate - especially in year one!","Well let me ask you this, do you like football at? Personally I only watch it a little bit, but my favorite quarterback is Tom Brady, who's your favorite quarterback?","I do and I\\'m in agreement with you. Tom Brady is definitely my favorite quarterback or \"QB\". Can you believe his JV high team refused to start him when he was a back up while the team never won or scored a touchdown? That is unbelievable!","Wow that's insane! I wonder why they did it that way haha. Another thing I didn't know is that a deaf quarterback created the Huddle. He used it so that the other team could not see his hands signing","That makes so much sense and I'm sure coaches and players over the years appreciate him for that! Even left handed quarterbacks like Kellan Moore, who just so happens to be the only left handed QB in the NFL today!","That is shocking! Do you think it gives him an advantage or a disadvantage? Have you heard about Baker Mayfield as well? He was almost a professional gamer but switched over to playing for the NFL","I\\'m sure it probably gives him an advantage since it\\'s \"different\". But I didn\\'t know that about Baker. That was a wise choice, I\\'m sure in terms of pay. Even though engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of NFL and MLB players, but I would guess NFL players make more than pro gamers. Ha!","Haha I think you're right! A lot of these quarterbacks are really talented though. Did you hear about Alex Smith? He got his four-year degree in only 2 years and was working on his master's before joining the NFL","Wow! He must be a genius. People like him have the brains\/talent while people like Benjarvus Green-Ellis have such unique talent like never fumbling the football in their entire pro career!","That is an incredible feat! another incredible feet would be if a female player joined the NFL. Apparently there is no rule that does not allow for that","That us true. Makes you wonder why one had never been drafted or picked up by a team. The NFL gameplay is only an average 11 minutes, so you'd think they would at least sign a female to be a kicker or something!","Haha yeah right! I could see a female kicker. did you hear about the tracking chips that they put in players shoulder pads though? Hopefully they take those off so they can't be tracked when they're not playing haha","Oh, no kidding! No telling what those players do after a game! Ha! Then again, they could track Saints players to see if cheerleaders are dining in the same restaurant as them, which is forbidden. Can you believe that?","I can't believe that. In this day and age that seems completely unnecess on a separate note, did you ever bowl by chance? I guess top bullying players earn more than top football players back in the 1960s","Are you serious? Bowling must have been major back in those days. But I still don't think it's as unbelievable as Georgia Tech beating Cumberland 222-0 back in 1916, which to this day is the record for the highest score in footfall.","That is an amazing record! I wish that we had a video of that game because I would have liked to have seen that. Imagine how bad you would feel if you were a Cumberland fan that day haha., I wonder if they had a left-handed quarterback like Kellen Moore maybe that was their secret haha","Ha! No kidding. It would be interesting to see! Almost like the University of Iowa's visiting team locker room beinf painted completely pink. I bet that's a sight to behold! Ha!","Haha that would be a crazy thing to see! I always wonder if that would make me play better or worse though! What do you think?","It's tough to say. I suppose it could be motivational or depressing! But let's be honest: it isn't as innovative as ESPN creating the yellow first down line! Ha! They totally deserved an Emmy for that.

I can admit it's purely out of jealousy though so you have that going for you.","yea thats it true, i guess thats a good thing. you guys beat us last year though in the Super Bowl","That was really exciting for us last year. It felt good to beat one of the best teams out there. It was a nice bit of revenge from our previous match up. This year's Super Bowl was a lot more boring.","i agree with that 100%, what a snore fest! at least both teams showed up finally in the 4th quarter","How much longer do you think the Patriots Dynasty has? They haven't really planned for the end of Brady's career yet\/","i think either this year or next year will be his last. and who knows, with those issues with Robert Kraft there might be some ownership shakeup which could lead to some new thoughts on the coaching staff","I don't think Kraft is really looking at anything besides a fine and suspension. His public image definitely took a big hit, but a few other owners have been involved in some shady business and still own their teams.","thats true. its just such a silly thing he did. so many questions! ah well. did you know the highest scoring game was 222-0, i wonder what how the other team felt after that one","The defense had to be exhausted! The offense was probably ready for another game.","haha I wonder if the offense ever even hit the field!","With that score I have to believe there was some defensive touchdowns by the other team. If not they were on the field for 3 plays at a time.","thats crazy. why do you think University of Iowa paints the visiting footballs teams locker room pink?","If they think that's going to throw the other team off their game, they are probably mistaken.","they might think it has some sort of psychological effect, but im not sure it works","I don't think Iowa has any National Championships so I'm going to chalk it up as a failure.","haha i agree, they should reevalute their strategy","It was fun chatting football with you, hopefully we get the third match up in the Super Bowl so we can break the tie between the Eagles and Patriots!","lets hope! itll be an interesting game"],"emotion":["positive","negative","happy"]},{"dialogue":["Good morning!

I know they used to have a deaf quarterback which was also surprising to me.","I heard that's how the circular huddle came about so they other team couldn't see the play calling.","I've heard that too. You know, I had always thought the huddle was just part of the game so the team could call the play.","I thought so too. Baker Mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming.","Baker Mayfield has so much confidence he can probably do anything and be good at it! I mean, he has made the claim that he can beat anyone at his school at one on one halo 3.","I agree. Alex Smith took so many AP tests in high school that he was automatically a junior when he started college.","He must be really smart and high achieving! So does that mean he was only in college for two years before being drafted?","I think so, but not too sure on that.","I guess he was younger than other draftees. Yet he is still just as good as the rest. What do you think about women becoming players?","I could see them being a kicker, but that's about it. What about you?","I don't know. I know that by rule they have to meet the nfl's eligibility requirements. I guess if they can do that then I can see them being players. I just don't know if any teams would take them.","I agree. Did you know the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay?","No, it seems like so much longer. I guess that means that most of the three hours is just commercials then?","Commercials and play calling.","That could explain why the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than a player's.","I think so too.

Maybe they should hold on to Flacco another season.","True his teammate was also a heisman winning running qb.

I'm not saying there's no sexual harassment, but everything is too pc.","Oh, I see what you mean. You mean they don't want the football players and cheerleaders to date or socialize to avoid any harassment issues.","Yes, but to me that is silly. Like why would they wear such outfits? If you find it demeaning, or however, don't take that job.","The cheerleaders are assigned to wear skimpy outfits to entice male viewers. I'm not sure if you're connecting the outfits to the rule about not eating in the same restaurants or not.","Yes, I am. I'm saying everything is over sensitive now.","I suppose you are right. There has been so much publicity about harassment and it looks bad when NFL players are caught doing something like rape, or assault.

I think he was a 6th round pick too in the 2000 draft so every team passed on him before the Patriots signed him.","Crazy! Good thing he did not give up. But it is good to have a backup plan like Alex Smith who got his bachelor's degree before being drafted into the NFL.","That was pretty impressive.

Yikes!","That game must have been something to see, for the winning side. Did you know that a high school stadium in Texas seats 18,000 people and cost $60 million?","Wow, I'd say that's a lot for a high school stadium. Must be a huge school.

Maybe because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.","For 11 minutes of live gameplay the NFL sure has a lot of injuries","You are right! It's amazing how much football has developed in popularity. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.","Yea, football is so popular espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down line","And there are even tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads","I wonder what the NFL does with all the data from those embedded chips, hopefully they use it for player safety","Yeah, hope so. There is so much competition in football to become a football player. Maybe more people should aim to be engineers instead. Over a lifetime their average earnings are higher.","Yea or they could study harder in school like Alex Smith did, he started college as a junior","Yeah I like that he had a backup plan. Benjarvus Green-Ellis seems like he has always been sureof himself. He has never fumbled the football in his nfl career.","That is pretty impressive. I wonder if there will be any female players in the NFL since there is no rule banning them","Yeah, I have heard there is an up and coming woman kicker. But in other ways the NFL seems sexist, like how Saints cheerleaders must leave an establishment even if they are already eating, if Saints players come in.","Yea that is a messed up rule, I wonder what would happen if the Saints had female players on their team","Yeah, hopefully this changes.","Did you know that Baker Mayfield considered quitting football to professionally play video games?","That seems kind of crazy but professional gaming can be lucrative as well.","Yea and less injuries playing Halo 3 than professional football","Right? It's surprising that Tom Brady kept believing in himself and not giving up and going to a different profession. When he was in high school his team refused to start him even though they had a terrible season.","Yea, I disagree with Tom Brady's JV coach's decision to not switch qbs after failing to score a touchdown all season","Yeah and now he is a four time super bowl champion. I'd be embarrassed if I were his HS coach!"],"emotion":["positive","interesting","curious"]},{"dialogue":["Nick Foles is a good players and the Eagles are lucky to have him","They should start using him more, he has had a lot of brilliant moment on the league, they should exploit that","Absolutely. I understand that his track record when he was their starter was shaky, he has a 64% rating, but if they rotated him and Wentz he would get more chances to play and increase his skill level.","I guess he let down a lot of fans, Wentz was the second overall pick in t he 2016 draft right?","He was 2nd in that draft. But they could still be favorites they just have to prepare Foles for Atlanta.","Seems like do you like the NFL a lot, any favorite teams?","I am a pretty big football fan in general. I am a Pittsburgh Steeler fan. Ben Roethlisberger has the most wins of any quarterback... in Cleveland!","I am a fan of the Patriots, Steelers have a rich history, how are they doing lately?","This season could have been better. We were playing really well and at the top of the Division but started losing to teams we should have easily beat. Patriots? Have you ever been to a game?","No, never, cant afford tickets so maybe one day, seems like a bit of a scam when there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay","I know they are really expensive, but I hear it is a nice stadium. Not big though. No NFL stadiums are really that large which is odd.","Have you been to a steelers game before? and yeah stadiums are really big, the cost a lot too","I have not. I live across the state so it would be an expensive weekend. I do go to Penn State games though. Ironically, they have the 2nd largest stadium in the country and their tickets are far less expensive than the NFL.","I like college football, its a good thing you can get them for a good price.","It makes me happy to be able to go to games. There is a big difference between live and watching on tv. I also went to the school with I believe the 2nd largest high school stadium in the country, after the Allen, Texas stadium.","It is, games are more exiting, I am glad football exists, I wish I could afford to go to the Super bowl maybe one day I can and maybe the Pats will be playing that day,","Well you have had a lot of luck with them going these last few years! I hope to go to the Super bowl someday too. Until then I guess I will stick to college games and try to get to Pittsburgh!","Maybe they will play the Super bowl against each other and we will be on opposing sides! if thats the case may the best team win with no hard feelings","That can't happen, they are in the same league. The most we can see them play each other is during the regular season and in playoffs. And yes, no hard feelings!

I find it funny that pro bowlers used to make twice the pay as football stars!","that is funny, also weird that there are only 2 black quarterbacks that won the superbowl overall","Wow, that is interesting! have you ever heard of Al Michaels?","I have didn't he lose a bunch of weight recently?","I am not sure, but he is well known for his on air gambling references between football teams","oh I didn't know that, well do you like Snoop Dogg at all?","I do like Snoop, didn't he write a fight song for his sons HS football team...","ya he did, I like his music, did you know the top paid employees of the DOD are three football coaches, seems like a waste of money","Wow, I agree! So something surprising I read is that in a football game...there's actually only 11 minutes of live play...","ya that is surprising, did you hear a football stadium in texas cost 60 mil, and that it was for a highschool?!","Seriously! that's strange! Have you heard of Alex Smith?","I think so, hes like a genius right? kinda like the guy who created the NFL's tracking chips","Yeah, he is smart and was the 1st overall pick in the 05 NFL draft...good thing he took the football path!","ya I agree! but ya the tracking chips can track the speed and rotation of the ball, kind of crazy! I bet they get some cool stats","I bet they do too! Great invention! Too bad they didn't have that technology back in 1916 when that football game was played where Georgia tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0!","haha that could have turned the tide! we've come a long way since then though, but still a huge american flag costs $50,000 now that is insane"],"emotion":["curious","positive","excited"]},{"dialogue":["Hi, do you like football?","That's good. Yes, I love football. Did you know Iowa painted their opposing team locker room pink?","I have heard that...it's funny! I guess it was a power play for them?

That was probably the most boring game to ever watch!","That would have been terrible to be on Cumberland's team. How depressing.","Depressing and embarrassing!","For sure. The 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars.","Wow, that's something! I wonder what those stats are now...football stars probably make 5x what top bowlers make!!","I wonder as well. Green-Ellis who is a running back never fumbled his entire NFL career.","With stats like that I hope he was the highest payed running back!

Do you watch ESPN?","I don't watch it too often. Do you like the NFL?","I don't have a favorite team, but my husband likes the Cowboys. Did you know that women could play in the NFL? They'd have to meet the league's eligibility requirements...but they could do it!","I bet they could do it too. I could see them being a kicker or something like that.","Yeah, maybe! I wonder what the league requirements are? What I think about every time I watch an NFL game is that there is an average of only 11 minutes of actual gameplay.

What do you know about Lamar Jackson of the Ravens?","I don't know much, even though Baltimore is not too far.","Well, Jackson is a former Heisman Trophy winning QB from Louisville, who the Ravens traded up to take in the first round of the draft.","Interesting, did he set any records while in school?","He sure did. Only player in FBS history to rush for at least 1500 yds and pass for at least 3500 yds in a season, and he did that twice!","Interesting. Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for that Yellow first down marker?","Yeah,, where would we be without it! It is almost as important to football these days as the huddle, that oh-so-familiar circling up of players around the QB to hide signal calling.","Did you know that in 60s bowlers made more than football stars?","Where did bowlers go wrong? Apparently the popularity of football has exceeded bowling. I wonder if some other game will pass by football as the most popular soon? Perhaps gaming? Some pretty high profile college football players have considered not going pro in lieu of starting a career in gaming!","I think it just got old. If I were a college player and could go pro, I would go pro. You are only young once.","Yeah, but football makes you grow old more quickly than other games... If you are on the losing end of a lopsided loss, like the historic 222-0 tarring Georgia Tech gave Cumberland, you can grow old quickly...","That's true, even though there is only 11 minutes of game play. Pretty crazy, huh?","You can beak your neck a thousand times over within that time. And the NFL will have the event recorded via tracking chips in your equipment so that they can tell how quickly the train that hit you was going...","I think they also put chips in the football as well, but I'm not entirely sure what for. Any ideas?","To monitor speed, rotation, velocity, and location. Heck, they even monitor the location of cheerleaders in New Orleans, where they forbid them from dining in the same restaurant as any player. I wonder where they put the chips...In the pom poms?","Interesting. I think a lot of teams have that rule. Did you know that there is no written rule against female players?","Yeah, but there are minimum eligibility requirements that still need to be met, which eliminate most men...so, I wonder what percentage of the women qualify?","I think all they have to do is be good enough to play to be honest.","Yeah, but good enough to play in the National Football League is still a pretty high bar.

I would think that will be repainted soon in today's climate - I don't like it!","Really? I kind of disagree, because I think it is a smart strategy that they use in order to give themselves an advantage during the game. Therefore, from a game point perspective painting your opposing team's locker room pink is a great move!","Interesting point - any advantage a home team can get over their opponent. I was thinking it may be antiquated in today's PC climate.","That is a very good point, it would really be interesting to see data about how the opposing team is impacted. For example, maybe they could analyze the tracking chips found on the shoulder pads to record a player's every move on the field.","Ii would think there would need to be a psychological measurement of the affect of the pink walls. I've heard about the chips in the padding and I wonder why they don't put chips in the ball to indicate if a ball breaks the plain of the endzone or sideline?","Apparently they do use the tracking devices inside footballs to track the ball's velocity, rotation, ball speed and location. I guess they do not advertise that as much during official games though.","Fascinating how technologically advanced the game is in some aspects, but antiquated in officiating where they missed 3 penalties on one play in that Saints-Rams game!","Yeah I can't believe that they missed that even though the technology has become so advanced. You would expect them to track all this data especially when there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.","That stat has always baffled me - 11 min of action. So much downtime and wasted time!","I agree, that would explain why the Superbowl commercials are so popular. It is because most of the game is just watching advertisements, with only 11 minutes of real live action.","Super bowl commercials were so-so this year. The Burger King \/ Andy Warhol one was the most memorable one for the wrong reasons!","I did not watch the super bowl commercials this year, but heard that they were very boring. A lot of my friends told me it sucked this year and was a waste of time to watch","Overall your friends are correct. I wasn't a fan of either team and watched it with friends, beers, food, good times - terrible game!","That's disappointing to hear, hopefully next year it will be a better game!","Maybe - but I wouldn't be surprised if it was the Patriots again... winning... boring as it might be","Yeah, they are a tough team to beat. Maybe one player will decide to quit like Baker Mayfield did in order to pursue a full-time competitive career in gaming.

I think quite a few football players have unique names such as Jake Butt of the Broncos.","Yeah at least those were their given names and not something like Chad Ocho Cinco because of his number.","That's true! I think Amari Cooper has had many injuries in his NFL career. I'm surprised the Cowboys are so happy about that wide receiver; the risk of re injury seems high in football games.","Yeah the sport has sped up a lot and coming back from an injury always puts you at a higher risk of it happening again.","I think Cooper came from the Raiders to the Cowboys?","Yes I think thats how it worked out. So is there really chips inside players shoulder pads?","I think so! The NFL even has those chips in the actual footballs. I wish I could have thought of that idea! Who knows how advanced football with be in a few decades, right?","No joke. Can you imagine if helmets were still just made of leather.

They even griped about the group performing at Half Time (Maroon 5) although I understand they had a hard time even gettting anyone to perform. Wonder if the commercials were any good this year though...","It was a defensive struggle, Maroon 5 was really just Adam Levine showing off, and the commercials were rather bland. It's crazy to think that in terms of actual gameplay, the halftime show was longer as an average NFL game just has about 11 minutes of live action.","11 minutes? It's hard to believe there's so little actual action in a game!

Hehe...","Being from Nebraska I know all about Iowa's ploy to gain any psychological advantage!","Yeah, it's kind of interesting... they've done studies and found color's really do effect people psychologically. REad about an experiment where they painted a weight room pink and they found the lifters couldn't lift as much as they normally could. Crazy, huh?","Yep! Another crazy thing to me is that bowlers used to make more than football players!","Oh yeah, that was back when bowling was a HUGE thing They'd even have celebrity bowling TV shows and stuff.

I wonder which group it protects? They definitely invest in their players. Did you know they have made chips to track about every movement on the field a player makes?","Yeah, I heard about that... they've got a chip in the ball as well... probably makes it easier to go statistics and whatnot.

My neighbor was a running back for the Cardinals and he made $7 million in his last season. But on average, engineers make more than NFL players over a career.","Maybe your neighbor could become an engineer later in life after he retires from football. The earnings of an engineer are good.

In the 1960's, top bowlers earned more than NFL players.","Top bowlers were lucky that the professional leagues didn't have their act together. College ball was big, and TV hadn't grown enough.","You are right. Also, the NFL has to pay a lot more players than the 10 or 12 top bowlers.

But, you can say technology has really changed the game. We have tracking chips in the uniforms and the ball and 2-way radio in the QBs helmet. It sure has changed a lot from the days of hand signals between the QB and the coach on the sideline!","for sure. did you now bowlers used to make more than football players back in the day?","I did not know that. We often here about the mega contracts the star players get but not the contracts of the average and 2nd string players. I recently learned that because of the short career in pro football, the average lifetime earnings of a typical NFL player is less than the lifetime earnings and an engineer.

I wonder how Jason Witten would have done, but he's affiliated with ESPN so I'm not sure how that would have worked.","ESPN and the booger mobile are awful! They lost their sports brodcasting background awhile ago. Now its just social media and advertising","Yup, I used to watch Sports Center religiously, now I might put it on once or twice a year. They really focus on the NFL, and would really be interested if they ever got a female player. After all, there is no written rule against it.","Would she feel weird if she got drafted by the Saints. Where the players and cheerleaders are not allowed to eat at the same place?","Yeah, that would be awkward. She would walk in and the cheerleaders would have to leave.","Jason Witten was a very good player but still needs some work in the booth. Maybe he can win ESPN another emmy","Maybe some day. I liked him during his 15 year career, and drafted him on my fantasy football team several times.","He is second in rec and yards as a TE. Thats good fantasy production","For sure. He and Dez Bryant back in the day made quite the pair. Plus catching balls from Troy Aikman wasn't too shabby either.","If the average NFL game only has 11 mins of live gameplay. I wonder how much time Witten was actually used","Good point. I still like watching it on TV though. Never seen any of the over 750 episodes of pokemon though.","Thats 16 years worth! I dont think I would be able to stand the ads","I don't I'd be able to stand the show. 50 a year? I couldn't even get through one I bet.","What about trying to find the 1 episode of the simpsons where Bart is neither mentioned or appears","At least I used to like that show. Haven't seen it in years though. I tend to use TV as a mass medium for news.

They are also using tracking chips on the players now","yes they collect info on velocity and rotation and a bunch of stuff","I hope they can use that to make the game safer too","Good point. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink","I wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on the players","Yeah me too.

Who is your favorite team?","RaiderNation here and Antonio Brown!!! Maybe we can score 222 points like georgia tech now.","Haha, score a few more points than Cumberland did. AB84 to the Raiders is pretty cool, he seems like a Raider for sure.","I knew as of Friday. A bunch of Raider fans who are also Warrior fans saw him at the Warriors game. He got Currys jersey from him!","That's cool, it is always nuts to remember that the Warriors play in Oakland, they seem like 2 very different teams.","Not as of next Season. They will be next to the SF Giants lol. I bet Lebron could play in NFL haha. Probably not fumble like benjavus green-ellis!","LeBron would be unstoppable as a TE for sure, he'd never fumble either.

It is almost done.","Ah I gotcha, the Raiders are going to Las Vegas the year after next right?","Yeah, good thing there is only 11 minutes of actual play. It might be hot there lol.","It'll be getting really hot there. Do you watch a lot of TV?","No worries. It is inside. I was kidding. Yes I watch tv but I stream more.","Yah, TV channels and stations are kind of rip offs now, you have to pay a ton of money each month and still watch a ton of commercials, not a very good deal. You ever watch any of the 750 episodes that were made of the show Pokemon?","It will take me 16 years if I watched one a week","That's a really long time for sure. I was rather surprised to hear that there are only two types of TVs still, black and white and colored TV. Pretty soon there'll be VR TV lol.","I can watch Netflix already with my VR headset! I want to find that UK knock off of the 70's show lol.","That would be pretty cool, what if we're already in VR now though? Kind of freaky.

Did you know there is no rule against females playing?","Yeah I wonder why they do not play though","Maybe because they could make more as an engineer.","haha that is so true. it is sad how little players make really. the coaches make a lot though","Yeah, they are usually the highest paid in the state.","yeah. snoop dog though wrote a song for his son's football team","really?

Apparently, a lot of people played it.","ya thats true, you have to travel to different places to get different pokemon, and only some pokemon were given away at special events, and some are locked to certain countries, it just seemed too impossible","Yeah, I liked the game. I also liked the show that 70s show, apparently they tried to make a UK version.","ya I remember that, and it was cancelled after like 10 episodes! Oh well they're missing out over there","I didn't know that Ringo Starr voiced Tank the engine though.","wow I didn't know that, I did know that George Carlin did some voices for Thomas the Tank, I wish he would sneak in some jokes then I'd actually watch that show haha","Apparently the new tvs have OLED, so does the new iPhone. I'm debating whether or not to upgrade.","ya I don't know, it depends what your current phone is, I have a pixel xl 2 so I have a great phone I'm good waiting for a while","LOL, I still have the iphone 5s, I've never used a case and dropped it a million times. It won't die.","haha well that phone is pretty old, maybe get a new one so you can watch nfl games on it, apparently the average game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay","Not surprising, when I watch the games at the bar, it is mostly clock watching.","ya, espeically near the end when they're using timeouts, I can't believe in teh 60's that bowlers made more than top football players","I can believe it. That is crazy, but years ago bowling was likely a more popular sport.","ya that's true, it was in the flintstones and everything haha, also crazy that an engineer will make more in their lifetime than the average football player, very shocking","It has to take into account for the players that don't last long and are low pay.","ya thats true, also the ones that get injured, did you like the simpsons as a kid? theres only one episode where Bart is both not mentioned and doesn't appear","Yeah, Bart.

I hope they perform the old songs and Maps!

This is getting more exciting by every message I see. They deserve it!","I'm glad that ESPN doesn't get the game though. Have you heard any of their issues since taking over Monday Night Football a while back?","What do you mean that they don't get the game? Well, there are a few people considering the job.","CBS hosts the game. Obviously ESPN will be part of it, but I hope that the game is always on \"free\" tv. Plus ESPN just hasn\\'t done that great with the actual NFL games.","Now, it makes sense. Is that sarcasm because it is never free? NFL is good overall.","I meant for the people watching since NBC, CBS, or Fox usually host the game and those don't cost consumers (beyond the television and possibly an antenna), whereas ESPN requires additional pay to watch.","That is true. Speaking of television, \"Shark Tank\" never enacted most deals. Seems reasonable because the products that consumers create seem ridiculous to make it a reality.","That is interesting and I never knew that! It\\'s hard for me not to see \"Tank\" and not think of Thomas the Tank Engine. Did you know some famous stars like Alec Baldwin, Ringo Starr, and George Carlin have all narrated the show?","I remembered watching the episodes when I was little. And I heard about that! That makes me want to do back and identify their voices.","They all have such distinct voices too! It's crazy to think in the relatively early days of television that bowlers made more than football stars.","Actors make more money than bowlers and football players. However, I heard of that as well. I wish bowling was easy though.","I think all sports tend to be tough because some people just really have a knack. While I think it might be difficult, maybe someday a woman will suit up and play in a Super Bowl since it is technically not against NFL rules.","Well, they have practices every other day to develop strength and stability. I believe so. Look at high school football. Coaches are welcoming of both genders to condition into football.","Yet despite all of that, New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't even eat in the same restaurant as the players.

After all, the guest house is bigger than the White house!","ya that is wild, you would think it'd be the opposite, can you imagine if we had the old rules where the runner up became VP? Hillary as VP and Trump as President!","I would love to hear Trump say to Hillary, \"You\\'re Fired!\" I can\\'t imagine the types of things the fake media would focus on then. With all the bizarre reporting, at least they don\\'t call him President Banana, which is what they called the first President of Zimbabwe","haha ya I would love for him to have her come into his office and then tell her she's FIRED, do you watch football at all? I guess there is no rule against women playing for the NFL so we will probably see that in our lifetime if they are good enough","That is true in the NFL, but I am not sure if it is true in other forms of football, like rugby, canadian football, Gaelic football, etc. Does that mean we would see male Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders too?","To be honest nothing would surprise me anymore, weren't they talking about making cheerleaders more equivalent and having men as cheerleaders? Like I am pretty sure that is a thing they're working on.","College football has male cheerleaders on the squads. I remember seeing them at a University of Iowa game. I also heard that their visitors locker room was pink.","lol, that is funny, ya I saw that is in Iowa's away team locker room, I'm frankly shocked the team wasn't arrested for intolerance or gender discrimination given today's overreactions and political climate","I think political correctness has gone too far lately.","ya now that sounds like a complete opposite of today, what is shocking to me is that there is only about 11 mins of actual live gameplay during an average football game, seems like that is low","And most of that is hang time for punts!

Just like I couldn't believe the football game that was won with a score of 222-0 that had to be a crazy game!","I know Georgia Tech made history by beating Cumberland back in 1916","Exactly!

I hope so.","I hope so too because otherwise it is just so sexist and wrong","I definitely agree. I think the NFL is probably better at treating the cheerleaders better than that in current times.

I can't believe the FDA was against literature back in the day.","People can have some interesting ideas. I head there is a Dr. in Texas that teaches a heavy metal literature class. What do you think it covers?","That is very interesting. It probably covers some good music for sure! I feel like many students have neck strains from head banging lol.","I wonder if you get extra credit if you start growing your hair out for that class? lol I had a mythology and fantasy class in college. It was pretty good.","I'm sure that was interesting too! Did they teach you about the fantasy congress that exists?","No, but maybe their kids are in the fantasy spelling bee! I saw the artwork of that Chicago janitor who died and only then was his work discovered. It's very unique!","Oh really? That would be neat to see.

I'm interested to hear further about it.","I know that they had Norse Gods that were before Jesus Christ. I'm still in the awakening of knowing more about them.","Could you tell me more about it?

Have you heard of a palindrome?","Yea, I'm vaguely familiar with it, I'm just glad I don't have to write one","I can't even begin to comprehend how demetri wrote a 224 word palindrome and how it would even go","I feel anxious just thinking about it. There's a poem consiting of 800 irregularly prounced words that is 274 lines long","One thing I find inspiring is that there is a poem that if read normally is depressing, but backwards is inspiring","That does sound awesome.

Edgar allan poe only received 9 bucks for the raven","Yea I heard Poe died without much money. Tupac studied poetry in high school in baltimore as a teen","Literature is kinda like art.

There are no snakes in NZ","Interesting. I knew there weren't any in Ireland or Hawaii.","The fear of snakes is hard-wired not only in human brains but also in monkey brains. Were you ever afraid of your corn snake?","No, I've never been afraid of snakes -- I mean, I'm afraid of them intellectually if I know they're venomous, but I enjoy handling them. Are you afraid of them?","Generally, I have a healthy respect for them. Thanks for using the word venomous. Many people say poisonous, but that's for things we eat (or shouldn't eat)","I don't think I've ever seen a venomous one, except at zoos and the like. I see a lot of black snakes and grass snakes here, and they're handy for keeping down rodents that bother my garden.","There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey. Have you ever seen any of these? Sounds terrifying.","I never heard of them before. I wonder if they just use their muscles to launch themselves from against the ground?","I only care if they're venomous! And if they're out bothering my garden. The organs in a snake can be one in front of the other, instead of side by side. Makes sense.","I used to have a dog who was terrified when I pulled the garden through the grass LOL.","I'm sorry? Pulled the garden through the grass? Sounds rather poetic! Are you a poet?","Nah, I meant pulled the garden hose *headdesk*. But snakes are actually good for gardens -- they eat the rodents that feed on green stuff.","I don't hate snakes, I just have a wariness around them. I stay away from them, they stay away from me. They can eat all the rodents they want. They can have my share.","My cats love torturing them, unfortunately.","I have similar attitudes toward cats as snakes. I am indifferent.

I'm not sure how I would have even went about it! Lol. Speaking of snakes is making me think of the story about Medusa.","Medusa... medusa... that chick who was turning in stone anybody who looked in her eyes ?","I'm not quite sure, but all I know is that she had snakes as hair... literature sure was interesting back in the day!","Yeah that was a cool story - somebody defeat her by bringing mirror as a shield.

I didnt even realize that the movie is based in 1960 lol thats funny, they have so much technology in the movie. In the sequel we finally see the baby's powers.","Oh really? I would have never have guessed that, I guess 13 years doesn't seem too long then?","Do you like any disney movies?","I do, I really liked the Lion King, it was the first disney movie to be translated to Zulu for an African release.","Oh yeah that was a good one! Great music as well. Have you seen they are doing a live action movie of Aladdin? The cartoon was so good.","I saw that, the blue Will Smith? Lol, that'll be good. They're definitely not recycling their animation frames like they did in the 70s.","lol yeah, Robin williams was the perfect genie though!","For sure, RIP Robin Williams, it's unfortunate he gets so much flack, he must have felt so much pain in his life that it was that unbearable.","I know, its so sad. It seems common in comedians. You never know what they are really going through because they cover it up with jokes and stuff.","For sure, it is really sad. It's terrible then when people just go after them and hate on them when they've never lived a day in their shoes.","exactly, you cant judge, you just never know.","For sure, could you imagine watching wreck it ralph in the 1980s though? That's when they started developing that movie.","That wouldve been amazing honestly, I really like that movie. Hard to believe they started developing it then.","For sure, what was the movie about? That's some vision to start that in the 1980s.","It was about a video arcade and at night the characters would be able to leave their game and socialize in the circuit. But of course, there a few characters that try and cross over to other games for various reasons and things get crazy.","Oh wow, I think I should go see that. I saw it on Fortnite, so it's kind of like Toy Story?","Kinda like toy story, its really creative. The second one was not as good.","Oh dang, I never knew there was a second one out yet.

I did hear that 13 years before the sequel came out there was a video game form of a sequel.","Did you play that video game? I wonder how it compared to the movie. Is the aim to knock off the Underminer?","I did not. I don't know much about it apart from it exists. Do you enjoy Disney films?","Oh sure. The original Disney -- Walt -- was a genius. The company has an amazing record of films, animated and not.","They definitely do. Did you know that The Lion King was the first Disney film translated into Zulu?","Really? That's quite interesting! I guess that would be appropriate since The Lion King, which I love, is African.","It does seem appropriate. Apparently in the 70's the company recycled a lot of frames so you will see the same ones in other movies.","I guess there's a lot to be said about recycling, then. Anyhow, I'd like to take my step-grandsons to see The Incredibles 2. They'd enjoy it.","I'm sure they would. Did you take them to see Frozen?","No, their mom did. I saw Frozen on TV. I liked it. I guess some kids see it over and over.","Yes they do. It was so popular. That's good because it was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.","Glad to hear that. Hollywood doesn't have a great record of women directing films.","I agree. Hopefully a shift is happening soon. Disney makes a lot on merchandise. The toy industry gets involved before they even begin filming a production.","I suppose if anything would be hand in glove, it would be toys and popular movies for kids.","Most definitely. Off topic, but do you find birds interesting?","Yes. I live in the sticks in Kansas and am greatly cheered to see a bald eagle every once in a while.

Big Mistake.","Wow, did you know that Black panther is the richest of all the superheroes?","Man, I didn't know that. I did know that there is one character owned by both Marvel and DC.

Can be really frustrating but in the end being nominated would make me grow as an actor what about you?","I guess I agree, but being nominated so many times, but never winning would still be a bit depressing","It would be depressing, yeah, just like the movie Trojan Wars and their box office of barely $309 after a $15 million investment.","Lol true true.

There were some cases a few years ago where a gorilla was shot to get the kid back. Tough call.","Harambe, right? I find the girl to be incredibly dumb and nothing should happen to the cat. Just poor judgment.","Yes, Harambe. It was poor judgment. I know of a Kentucky town called rabbit hash, their mayor is a dog. I see that a town in Alaska has a cat for a mayor. I wonder if they trade post cards. Sister cities and all.","I don't think. They don't get along. They fight like cats and dogs.","Right, that is always a risk. I have never had a cat. It is said they fight, but really, does it not depend. Did your dog care at all about the cats?","Not really. Every once in a while she would let them know she was big but that happened infrequently. The young cat would play fight with the dog's tail and the dog was completely indifferent.","I think that most dogs would learn to tolerate what they can not catch.

The cat in the opening scene was found on set.","That's cool. I love The Godfather. No wonder that cat is so restless in the scene. There's a town in Alaska that's had a cat name Stubbs as mayor since 1997. Wonder if it has its own office?","I bet it does there are not many people in Alaska! Such a unique name too...Talkeetna.","Speaking of cats in odd positions, a physicist once published a paper with a cat as coauthor so he could write using the first person plural.","That is pretty ingenious. That way he wouldn't be criticized. I like his style!","The first cloned pet was actually a cat. Can you guess its name?","Interesting. Haha copy cat! Very clever!","Love it! Did you know there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia? That's nuts.","That is sad to hear. Maybe Teddy Roosevelt had one?

Apparently in Boulder Colorado, it is illegal to own pets.","What? That seems crazy! Wonder if there are ways around that law?","Oh now that you ask, yes I believe they just actually say you can be a pets \"guardian\" and it is basically the same thing!","Too funny. Germany became the first country in the world to give animals legal rights guaranteed by the constitution. Probably can't call them pets there either.","Yes good point. I wonder if Germany allows all pets? The reason I ask is because there are so many pets like rabbits, ferrets, pigs, gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, and many more!

They both have their roots in the english ballads I feel.","It's also funny because guitars like the fender stratocaster were designed for country music specifically but I know that that's a popular guitar among punk and indie musicians.","And we always think of the violin as such a classical instrument but it is included in so much of country music that it is iconic.","I think that combo of electric and acoustic guitars is such a classic across many genres now too.","Very true. I have a hard time with george strait and jeff bezos being cousins though","I know, that's so weird! I am always hearing about famous people who are surprisingly related like that.","Right?! They just seem to be polar opposites.","Seriously, that's true. But I guess success comes in many forms since they're both doing so well for themselves.","Very true. I think people still have a stigma about country because of its hillbilly roots.","If so I think that's simply because people fail to understand the rich, deep history of the genre- they think it's all about modern day redneck behavior but these are genres that were born nearly a hundred years ago at least.","Very true. It has woven through blues and rock.","So true! But then again, \"country\" was the most listened to rush hour radio genre just about ten years ago.","Musical tastes change so much in such a short time. It is good though-opens peoples eyes to the world around them.","It can almost be a bit sad too. I just read the other day that hip hop\/rap is now overwhelmingly the most popular genre in the US now, which I am not a fan of, but I guess technically it's like modern jazz.","I would much rather have vintage jazz.

I love animals, I just need a little more time to study all of them! hahaha Did you know is illegal to own a pet in Boulder , CO?","What its illegal to own a pet? How can that possibly be? That sounds crazy.","But they say you can be the pet's guardian.. who can understand that?","Oh wow, okay, I see what you mean. Its word games. I was noticing that in Japan there are more pets than children!","Wow , how could this be! And I did learn that there are more tigers that are livings as pets that living a wild life in Asia!!","Yike, tigers don't seem like ideal pets!

Well I'm a little neutral towards them. My family loves the team though.","I don't know much about the individual teams. Does your family have a connection to Spain, or did they just end up enjoying that team most?","Some of our family used to live in spain, so we just grew up loving the team.","That's awesome! I lived in Belgium when I was little. Never thought to check if they had a team, though.","Haha nice. Yeah so we have been watching them for awhile. I'm not a huge soccer fan though.","I played soccer when I was little and always liked playing more than watching. I was definitely not World Cup material, though.","I played soccer as a kid! I played in high school, but that's all. I'm terrible. But in high school no one got cut haha.","I played before high school, so at that age they were pretty soft on us. No one got cut from the team for us either. I think I still have my old soccer uniform shirt.","Nice. Do you know who won the world cup last year.

Maybe I'll actually watch it this year.","I don't think it'll be until 2022, since it's not a yearly tournament.","Lol shows how much I keep up with soccer.","Haha, I'm no expert either.

I have not even watched Black Panther which I hear was a big hit! He's the richest superhero.","You should really watch that one as well, yeah he has more money than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark combined and then multiplied","Yeah. I thought the script I have seen relating to Black Panther was made up. It turns out it is based on ancient script.","It was, wow, that is amazing, the actor of the movie is also really good, Chadwick Boseman is his name","I guess he got his break with the help of Denzel Washington!","Yeah Denzel paid for his education, that was a great thing to do, he must be really grateful because of that","Yes, cool he got to thank Denzel in person at the Black Panther premiere.","His role in Infinity War was awesome, maybe Denzel can become a hero for the franchise one day","So was there a lot of shawarma eating in Infinity War?","I think its because of the first movie and the ending scene, heroes gather in a shawarma place."],"emotion":["positive"]},{"dialogue":["Do you have a favorite Disney movie?","You're right; it is hard to choose.

I sometimes see them in movies but I really like looking for other movie characters in the movies, when they kinda do a special appearance lol","Did you ever see the movie Flubber? It's been so long since I've seen it that I don't remember much, but Bill Nye was the science consultant for the movie","I actually never seen that movie.. any good?","It stars Robin Williams, so you know it's going to be funny. Another funny one I like is Big Hero 6. They had to use a 55,000-core supercomputer to render that animation","That movie was really good too! I had no idea it was so hard to make.","I know! Minnie Mouse is still one of my favorite classic characters though. Her name is actually short for Minerva Mouse. Minnie is more catchy if you ask me","That makes sense, I never knew that. Mickey is my favorite. Did you hear there is going to be a star wars land in Disneyland?","That would be so epic! I would go just for that. It would also be cool to see the headquarters though since it's such a big leader in American animation","Yeah i think it will be open in the next year or so. Pretty awesome. Did you know on the ride Pirates of the caribbean there is an actual real human skull?","I think I read that in a book recently, actually. I haven't been on that ride yet, but it would be fun to go","Yeah the skull was donated by a school when Disneyland first opened. You have never been to Disneyland?","No, I haven't. I had the choice to a few years ago, but chose to do Six Flags instead. I also really enjoyed the San Diego Zoo, especially seeing all the species of birds","I never been to the san diego zoo but I hear its amazing.","When I went, there was a peacock walking around among the visitors.

It\\'s funny, with all my allergies, I didn\\'t have any problems with the horses.","Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses. Must have been a pain for all his movie roles with horses.","He probably had a bunch of Allegra or something on set. Poor guy! It's weird, do you know there are horses that are born black and brown but turn completely white about six years in their life?","I have heard of them. I believe they are call lipizzaner horses. White horses are rare.","Yeah, I wonder if anyone ever saw one in the forest and though a branch was a horn, thus given birth to the idea of a unicorn? Be an interesting idea to research I think...","I would love to research how nature gave birds the ability to lay hard shelled eggs. They have a high metabolic rate. I assume from the all the exercise of flying.","Yeah, they have all sorts of interesting adaptation for flight.

All of them are. So many stars in one film.","I have seen it, I thought the technological lengths were impressive. It was the first film shot entirely with digital IMAX cameras.","Wow. That would be fun to watch in IMAX theater. I was interested to find that Disney does not own the rights to some marvel characters like spiderman.","That's interesting, I have also heard Sony was offered exclusive rights to all their characters, but only purchased the rights to Spiderman because they didn't think people would care about other characters.","Really. That seems to have been a big mistake for Sony. The plots to these movies a all the same basically... fight for good against evil.","I agree, and yet they last forever seemingly. The same actor who originally voiced the Hulk in the 1970's has voiced the character for decades since.","Really? Each of the heroes have their own personalities. I like the Hulk, too.

The most interesting character I know is access, it's owned by both Marvel and DC, and it's only purpose is to keep the two companies separate.","Do you know that in reality, the universe is amazing and there may even be another universe in a black hole?","That's interesting, people have their theories about everything in the universe. I've heard on that there is only one electron in the whole universe!","Amazing! There are lots of sounds out there in the universe. It's thought that in a black hole the sound that is 57 octaves below middle c is emitted.","I wonder how they measure something like that. It would be interesting to measure outside the observable universe, where a region of space might be pulling galaxies outside.","Only God knows. I've heard there are sounds that come from other parts of the galaxies. Recorded!!","That's scary to think honestly. I've heard the universe may only be one giant superhologram, maybe that would mean even these sounds are fictional too.","Wow!!! Am I a part of a superhologram?","Who knows?

That is pretty crazy that it had that kind of influence.","Agreed! But then you have people like the guy who voiced Jarvis in the Avengers and Iron Man films who's never watched any of the movies. Can you believe that?","That is odd, I am sure Lou Ferrigno has seen many of the hulk films since he started voicing the character.","I'm sure he has. Ha! I'm also sure the waitress in Avengers that Captain America saves (who also voiced the character Gretchen in Recess) has seen the films as well!","I think most actors\/actresses do. I guess some just want to be done with them.","I don't blame them one bit. Acting has to be stressful. I also wonder how stressful a scientist's job is?

That is pretty interesting if you ask me!","It is, as well as stars so cold we could touch them!","That would be awesome to do! They also say there's a part of space that could possibly be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe. That is crazy, isn't it?","It is! I think the universe is always expanding and that might be why.","It could be.

I wonder if we could get a similar USPS deal?","I really doubt it unless you ship a lot more things than I do. you see where it's illeagle for kids under 16 to play video games in South Korea after midnight, that a good idea, especially on school nights but how would the government enforce that (seems like parents should know that already and want their young kids asleep at midnight)?","Apparently as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week.","Yes, and since I play none there's a few out there playing a lot to run the total up. You see where Amazon is the third most valuable company in the US by market capitilization. I mean they make some electronic devices, they really just ship goods from manufacturers to consumers.

But if Jane McGonigal can calculate that as a planet we play three billion hours of video games per week, maybe they can monitor kids in South Korea.","Yeah, wonder what the punishment is, but seems like kids who play video games can stimulate their creative brains like MInecraft who partnered with unhabitat to let kids design changes they want to see in the games.","The military even used video games called \"cathode ray tube amusement devices.\" Probably those games were more for a combat mission function.

Hard to believe her first film role was a sports movie.","I never saw it. She probably got nominated for that too. After all, she is the most nominated actress ever with like 18 nods. That's more noms than most actresses get roles in their lifetime!","I hear ya! Very surprising that although she got nominated so many times, she has only won 3 times.","Tough business. It was nice to see he and Stanley Tucci reunite in Julie and Julia! Their performances made me hungry!","I saw that one too, they were awesome in it.","Yeah, and since Tucci is an excellent cook, he made Streep cook for him in preparation for the role as the famous Julia Childs.","That's cool!","I wonder what kind of preparation she did for her role in Holocaust which earned her an Emmy?","IDK, it was probably something very intense. I'm sure.","Do you know what producer Dino de Laurentis said after she auditioned for a role in King Kong?","I heard he said in Italian that she was ugly. But, was shocked when she replied back to his insult in fluent Italian. How funny!","Nice. I bet he wishes he could eat those words! She has even been nominated for 15 British Academy Awards, which is insane considering the amount of British talent that had to be overlooked.","That's so true. On a different note, do you like Shakespeare?","It used to be my nickname! Not because I am as old as Shakespeare... since he was alive during the time of Pocahontas, which is a little older than I. What's your take on SHakespeare?","I love his works. Was shocked to find out that he invented the names, Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia. How cool!","That is nice. And they are so popular still today!

Also, I didn\\'t agree with that Facebook video that was shared 38,000 times either where the guy claimed the item \"looks as menacing as anything I\\'ve ever seen\".","It just takes one statement to get forwarded to create a scandal. There seem more important things going on in the world to get worked up about.","So true. I mean, I doubt the pilgrims ever got worked up over any of their wardrobe and it was always full of color!","I've never worried too much about clothing, probably about as much as the pilgrims did. My wardrobe is pretty basic, based on cost as anything else.","So true. I wonder what kind of wardrobe we could find in that Alabama store that sells only clothes and cameras found in unclaimed baggage at airports.","I think that's maybe where I do draw the line. I'd sooner it new than second hand. Some of my shirts are getting a little worn, maybe I should get a couple of new ones","Same here! I need to find a new button down.

If not for the aloha shirt then for the sun and sea!","Ha! So true. Must be nice never having to wear a suit and tie - especially when it's hot out. That sounds so much more convenient! On a related note, the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral didn't wear a suit and tie either, they wore khakis and blue shirts! Ha!","If that's what you what then fine.

I bet Nike products cost more than smaller dinosaur fossils. Or that glow in the dark dinosaur coin that Canada has!","I'm still waiting for scientists to make dinosaurs come back like Jurassic Park. Then humans could live side by side with them","I mean, they've managed to genetically alter chickens to express the DNA their dino ancestors had, so anything is possible!","It'll happen one day, then we could all have a pet T-Rex.","So true.

It was inspired by a literary authors like Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley.","Oh, speaking of Poe, did you know that he wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg?","No I never knew that that was quite interesting. Watching horror movies is a very energy intensive task and you can burn up to 180 cal.","I can believe that! It probably speeds up a person's heart rate so fast that it's like running. Isn't it odd that horror has been around since the days of Poe, Stoker, and Shelley?","Yeah very cool. Or also overlaps with a fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres. That makes sense. Kind of like a potpourri of genres.","It does. You can watch a show about aliens and it can be frightening in the extreme. Have you heard that watching a horror movie before viewing abstract art makes you like it more?","No I never knew that but I will have to try it sometimes. The water phone is the instrument that makes those creepy metallic noises in horror movies.","Really? That's interesting. It kind of takes some of the scary out to know just how things are done in movies.","Yeah very true.

I wonder if that was added to his epitaph on his grave.?","I would hope they would give him that epitaph. He made a lot of cameo's in the recent movies. He was a big part of the genera.

Those were very popular, It has some stereotyped and racist undertones. The only birds I see that I think are comical are pigeons.

Or maybe don't recognize the name. Gonna google him. Alien on of my favorites in that catagory.","I love those alien type movies, which is your favorite?","oh my. They're endless. The first was written over 1800 years ago by an ancient greek!","That is awesome, I did not know that! I was a big starship troopers fan","Makes you wonder if it was sci-fi or if aliens did visit us thousands of years ago.","dang, that is solid, there is a lot of conspiracy around that!

If you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art, you will enjoy the art more. So remember that next time before you go to an art museum!","I think horror films do a good job with the music to set the atmosphere","I agree. The creepy metallic noises that you hear while watching horror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone.","The waterphone indeed is a unique looking instrument","I've never seen one before. I'll have to look it up. The boy from the Shining Danny didn't know he was acting in a horror movie until several years later. lol","Ya I think the horror genre is very subjective","Are you a fan of Tom Cruise?","Yes, he is a great actor","Tom Cruise spent 2 years learning Japanese and swordplay in prepartion for the filming of \"The Last Samurai\". What dedication to his craft!","The plot of the last samurai is cliche, but he pulled it off well in that movie","Tom Cruise once threatened Tom Kruse, the inventor of the hoveround over the usage of his name. That seems kine of like a petty thing to do.","Personally while I respect his acting skills, I am not too interested in them as a person. Then again, you are right in that it is quite petty","He's kind of wacky for sure. He spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. lol","Hey who am I to judge?

I am surprised to know that the sun makes up 99.86% of the mass of our solar system.","I figure it was a lot, but it is almost all the mass. the planets are tiny.","I also found out from a scientific magazine that the sunset on mars is blue.","Yes, the atmosphere is different! That must be pretty cool. i dont want to live there though.","I do not want to live there either. Apparently there is a radio station that translate solar activity into sound and you can listen live to the sun's music.

Did you know he spent two years learning Japanese and using samurai swords in prep for that movie The Last Samurai?","I did not. I haven't seen that one either. Hopefully the 2 years was worth it! I bet the cinematography was good on that one. They have better and better equipment as the years go on.","Yeah I think you are right. Cinematography is pretty interesting. Did you know Roger Deakins a cinematographer has been nominated for 13 oscars and never won?","That is crazy! I\\'m sure he doesn\\'t feel that, \"it is nice to be nominated.\" I\\'m also surprised a woman has never been nominated for cinematography.","Yeah isn't that wild, you figure after being nominated so many times he would win. And I am too, I think that will change pretty soon here.","Horror films? Love them or hate them??","I like them. But in my opinion it is pretty hard to make a good horror film. Did you know watching horror films can burn a lot of calories?","I'm not a huge fan, but watch them on occasion. I can imagine they would burn many calories. My heart is pounding the whole time!","Yeah I can understand why they do too. Do you know what most of the metallic noises heard in those films is made by?","No I don't. What is it made by?","I guess its an instrument called a waterphone. I am really curious to see what this thing actually looks like.","I'm not sure, but i bet it is creepy looking. Stephan King is a great writer of horror films. What is your favorite?","Yeah he sure is, I always liked the original night of the living dead, the one in black on white. I thought it was good.

Did you know the young actor in the Shining, didn't know he was making a horror film?","i guess he was naive? what did he think it was?","I don't know what kind of movie you think you are acting in when there is a ton of fake blood around?","i guess he thought it was an adventure? who knows. maybe he was a slow kid.","Do you know what kind of instrument makes all of those metallic sounds in those movies is called?","um, i have no idea. is it a special instrument or something?","I guess it is called a waterphone, and yeah I think it is just used in movie effects.","a waterphone, like a saxophone? i guess that is a unique instrument.","I am not sure to be honest, I wonder what it does look like?","i guess it has water in it? maybe it just sounds watery.

I have not seen it, but I hear it is a good film, even if many movie-goers are uncomfortable with the content.","I like stuff like that more than say, Mission Impossible. If you took the action scenes and stunts out of those movies, there wouldn't be much left.","Yeah. When I was young, action was interesting. As I age, I appreciate the subtle elements more than the typical Mission Impossible formula of action, stunts, and familiar dialogue. I prefer something with a little depth.","The same here. I do think there is a difference between \"critic movies\" and \"audience movies\". I think with age one looks more for meaning, more like a critic.","Perhaps. Although there is something heroic about seeing an old man like me ( Tom Cruise is in his 50s) who can still run without groaning.","LOL. Yeah, good point. I did like him in Risky Business back when I could run without groaning.","But Hollywood looks for sell-able movies that can make money, and Cruise can deliver in that category most of the time. Hollywood is betting on a prequel to Mama Mia, with predictable refurbishing of Abba songs and vamp-ish wriggling to music. And yet, I still want to see that one.","Yeah, it's funny how things repeat themselves. I'm OK with that but I don't really like anything from the horror genre to return. Life's hard enough without horror in my free time. It encourages violence.","I guess a good movie is one you don't mind watching more than once. There aren't many horror movies I can say yes to that. Besides, watching a horror movie can burn up to 180 calories. Who wants that?","Yep, I don't know if Aliens is considered horror but I've seen it more than once.","I remember shivering as I read the original novel, Alien. There were some gory scenes. Comedy is easier to take. I wish Seinfeld was still on the air. Seinfeld pocketed over $800,000,000, so I guess he can afford to vacation for a decade or two.","Hee yeah... Loved Seinfeld... Lot's of money for a show that's about trivialities... I really like Poe when reading. Maybe its the cinematography that stresses me to lose all those calories.","Yeah, Seinfeld is worth more than Tome Cruise and Tom Hanks combined. I guess people will pay more for a comedian than for an actor.","Seinfeld has a well-rounded cast. I still recall certain things and chuckle to myself (e.g., the golf ball in the whale). I don't relive horror movies in a good way like that.","True. \"I can\\'t spare a square!\" And despite all the hilarity, Seinfeld never seemed to make really unusual decisions like so many TV stars. Like Cruise, who spent $10 million to build an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.","Agree. They kept it on a hilarious steady pace. Seinfeld has common sense.","Here is some trivia that defies common sense: Did you know that if you watch a horror movie before you go to the art gallery, you will enjoy the art more? Incredible, but true!","Hmmm. Not sure about that. Maybe for some are but I couldn't see that working for a Norman Rockwell exhibit.","Maybe it only works for MODERN art? Hey, nice chatting with you!

They are very naughty!","Birds skeletons are mostly hollow and weigh less than the feathers too.","That was interesting. I did not know that. Also, their respiratory and digestive systems are adapted for flight in a unique way.","Didn't know that. I suspect waterfowl have those adapted for swimming then too.","It's very possible.

There is one species that is truly wild.","Those fancy Lipizzaner horses they use for dressage are apparently born black or brown and take 6 years to turn completely white - I guess you wouldn't be able to see a white patch at that point.","Good point.

Just think though, Boseman couldn't initially afford to attend a summer theater program at Oxford until Denzel stepped in and funded it privately.","that is crazy, its nice too that he thanked Denzel 20 years later at the premiere","So true. So are you also a fan of comic books and superheroes?

I'd like to see some of Stan Lee's DC work as he actually wrote 15 DC comics.","huh that is interesting, also crazy that DC stands for Detective Comics, thats good to know","Yeah that's true. Wonder if DC released the comic series centered around repairing all the collateral damage caused by super heroes or if that was Marvel?","ya I don't remember, but which side do you like more Marvel or DC?","To be honest, I'm a DC man when it comes to comics but the movies, I'm all Marvel Studios - especially considering they release gems like black panther.","oh ya for sure, I like Batman the best but besides him I don't like anything DC, did you ever see the Garfield spinoff when he became a superhero?","Ha! No I didn't but I bet it was hilarious! I did hear about it though. I know it was entitled Pet Force. I should check it out one day as I was a huge Garfield fan growing up!","ya check it out! also funny could be that comic where a guy is normal on a planet of superheroes, his nickname is NORMALMAN haha","Ha! Ha! That sounds like a very interesting concept - being normal in a world of superheroes. Wonder how he would fit in with Black Panther. Speaking of which, did you see Black Panther's debut in Civil War?","no I didn't what happened? I do know that marvel's use of the term black panther is not named after the black panther party","I dont want to spoil it but it was great!

It had aspects of the traditional comic book but also drew on African history elements and tribal culture.","Yeah that is true. some of those symbols date back to the 4th century","That is cool. I thought that they were made up.","Yeah that is nice that has history to it, real one. Chadwick Boseman was once admitted into a nice and expensive summer theater camp in the UK but could not afford to go","I heard that, and he got funding through a private benefactor who turned out to be Denzel Washington!","Yeah that is so cool.

Stan Lee was a master of comic books, real genius a lot of imagination","The michigan state university probably has lots of copies of his work, they have the largest publicly available comic collection in the world","Wow is that so, sounds like a really complete library, they must have rare comic books in there.","Most of it must be either from Marvel or from DC Comics.","Have you heard of Normalman before?","I don't know much about him, but I think he was the only one without a superpower on a planet full of superheroes.","Yeah thats the one, I will have to Google more about him, I hope you have a nice night, I think Im going to Google Normalman now","Ya, you too, nice chatting with you."],"emotion":["positive","excited","interested"]},{"dialogue":["Do you have any favorite clothing?","Me too lol.

If they did something like that in the 80s I\\'d figure they\\'d be all over expanding their \"brand\" today. They were a lot less horrible then.","That is a good point. Speaking of clothing, did you know pilgrims actually wore colorful clothing","I remember reading that. They also brewed beer.

He holds the record for the most Oscars won by a man with 22 under his name.","Wow I guess his talent is feflected on the amount of oscars he has under his name, 22 oscars is a lot","Yeah it is, did you know that Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars?","No not really, did Blazing Saddles ever win?

I've seen the Hoggle costume before. It was lost in shipping and now resides at the unclaimed baggage museum in Scottsboro, Alabama.","Thats amazing, at least it didnt get lost forever, uniforms worn by the alliance on Firefly are actually old starship troopers uniforms","Oh wow, that's pretty neat, I wonder if that helped them save money in the budget? I heard that Sean Bean is so scared of flying that he hiked into location in full costume when filming Lord of The Rings.","He did? he must be really scared to wear that costume all the way up, Sean Bean is a great actor","He is a really good actor. Did you know that Pilgrim clothing was full of color? They only wore black for special occasions.","I always though of pilgrims in a black and white way, I guess we took the black and white uniform out of context,","I guess we did too, because that's what I've always thought of as well. Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?","No I didnt, I would buy an Apple tshirt, I wonder why they dont have one anymore","I'm not sure, it would be cool to have though.

I was more of a superman batman fan, haha.","Do you like Marvel or DC comics?","Both but if i have to choose it's Marvel hands down, for me. you?","I guess I like Marvel.

I just learned that the sun produces enough energy in a second to meet the need of all of planet earth for 500k years","Holy cow, that is an insane amount of energy. I wonder how that is all even calculated.","I wonder how someone figured that out. Here's another one. A lightning bolt is about 5x hotter than the surface of the sun.

How about you?","That's pretty cool, I haven't been near a horse for years. Did you know that dalmatians are thought to calm horses?","No I didn't. I bet Hildago's favorite movie was 101 Dalmations.","Yeah I bet you are right. I also heard that some high school students got suspended when they rode some horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', I thought that was pretty lame.","That's funny. I would just skip school. Speaking of movies though, Clint Eastwood had a mid-life allergy to horses even though he killed 3 men in one of his westerns for laughing at his horse.","Yeah that is a strange fact, I know he was in plenty of westerns and was around lots of them. And that is crazy!","Did you hear about the horse that people thought was a genius because he could do math, but really he was just reading the subconscious expressions of his owner to figure the answer?","No I never heard that, like you mean the owner was just tricking everyone?","No, the situation was the horse would be asked a question and then tap his hooves on the ground to communicate. And his owner would just make expressions subconsciously when the correct answer came about and the horse would pick up on it and stop tapping.","Oh now I understand, thanks. That is pretty funny to say the least.

He did this for several months. This helped to expose the gap between the rich and the poor.","Interesting. Is that a recent position ? I don't remember seeing it in the bookstore...","It is a book from 1903.","hmm... ok... not recent then :) lol You like old positions like that ?","I like both modern and old non fiction. Interestingly enough, country singer Jimmy Buffet is one of eight people to have both a fiction and nonfiction book get to number one on the New York Times best seller list. I wonder what they were about.","Oh, now that's really cool - I have to look up what was the fictional book about. Or maybe You know ?","No, I am not sure what the fictional book was. Apparently George W Bush liked ot read non fiction too. He read 186 historical nonfiction books and 14 biographies of Lincoln during his presidency.","Wow... sounds like really boring lecture :) for me I mean... but I guess it was pretty handy for him :)","It's interesting that he liked to read about Lincoln. Maybe it was more relevant for him since they were both presidents.","Maybe he took some tips from those books ? :)","Yes, I wonder if he did. Do you like poetry?","I like Nick Cave's poetry ;)","I don't really like poetry. Stanley Plumly is apparently a great poet who decided to turn to narrative nonfiction.","Interesting. I like dark poetry about people's weaknesses and our demons :)","Do you write any poetry? It seems like lots of authors often change their genre as time goes on.","Naah...

Are you familiar with Stanley Plumly who did nonfiction work of artists?","The poet? Yes, a bit. His language skills must have illuminated the lives of both British painters very well. Sublimely, maybe?","Perhaps, I believe his writings try to show what makes artist's work unique and lasting.","Yes. I feel for poor, old Constable, who couldn't seem to sell paintings in his lifetime.

I think i did this because when i growing i knew adults who were fascinated with him and wondering what the country would have been liked if he wasn't assassinated.","I get it. Don't honestly know of a really distinctive JFK biography, but I've got his book, Profiles of Courage, a non-fiction account of brave individuals I can really recommend. JFK could write well!","Yes, i read that many years ago. Did he write that while recovering from his World War II injuries?","Right, though he never really recovered. Non-fiction writers take responsibility for truth in the events\/people\/info. they present. Contrast JFK's sublime ability to do that, with our current president's daily lies and misinformation...writers may make better leaders???","Perhaps. I think our current president should become a fiction writer.","Well said. Maybe \"The Art of the Deal\" is just that: fiction. Are you familiar with the writer, Ellen G.

Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become known as Atlas Comics.","In 1998, marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a mere $25 million. sony rejected the offer, and only purchased the rights to spiderman for $10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him...imagine missing the opportunity to buy the rights or so cheap","I know they are really kicking themselves about that.

Sony turned them down and offered 10 million only for Spiderman? They thought that was the only character people would be interested in.","Do you think it's because Sony only wanted to create video games from the movies?

I think that we need to have women who are bad ass in all areas. Adding in a General and Spy to those ranks is good for women. What did you think of the idea of having an all female protection squad like the Dora Milaje?","Ya I mean that is fine. It says in this article that their sex appeal is obvious but secondary to their personality and skill. They didn't have a personality in my opinion, I guess they had skill but I find it very unrealistic that they are killing people who have guns with like swords and spears","I think that requires a suspension of belief which it sounds like didn't quite cross the gap for you. The comics go much more into detail of why Wakanda's weapons are swords and spears as you put it but that is quite a bit for a movie to explain until Ripley's weapons in the Aliens movies or Terminator weapons.

Tony developed all his own technology and Black Panther had a lot of help and inherited his wealth though his country. I did like that Dorothy Steel was able to make her acting debut as the old woman in Black Panther.

If we look back though you can find may movies in the past did very well. Look at the original Star Wars movies which if we adjusted for inflation would have made 1.3 billion at the box office.","ya that is crazy, it's also wild that walt disney owns marvel and the star wars movies, they really have exploded and its funny they were thinking about closing their doors when sleeping beauty was a box office failure","It is wild that Walt Disney has acquired all these properties. Not only Sleeping Beauty was a box office failure but other movies like John Carter and Children of Men which when we look back in time both were considered failure but Children of Men lost 8 million at the box office.","oh wow I didn't know children of men only made that much, I actually like that movie a lot, I did remember disney's treasure planet movie, that was a huge bomb, I saw it recently its ok but I can see why it wasn't successful","Yeah, it's sad that Children of Men lost that much money but ironic that Mortal Kombat 2 was the first video game to make more than Hollywood Box office sales before Call of Duty.

There is a great backstory to Chadwick having some of his education funded by Denzel Washington, and the movie premiere brought them together so he could thank Denzel. Neat, huh?","I heard about that, I think Denzel has a great heart, Chadwick thanked him over the premiere of the movie","Denzel has some awesome inspirational speeches on Youtube that you would probably enjoy seeing. I know I did. So, in the movie, was there reference to the Nigerian nsibdi script that the story features?","I didnt know that, but that is really cool sounds like the directors, scripts writers did a great job researching, so are you a fan of Marvel Comics?","In general, yes, although I am behind in my watching of movies...

I actually haven't seen Black Panther, but I want to after learning more. The actor that played Black Panther actually went to school with money from Denzel Washington!","Marvel did some censoring of the utterance \"praise hanuman\" due to possible backlash.","I'm not sure what that is referring to, but I'll look into it.

I doubt it was ever as successful was Black Panther though, which was obviously created for different purposes.","Yep I agree with you. Did you ever see the movie Black Panther by the way? I thought it was ok, nothing special","I did! Yeah I thought it was alright, I thought it was interesting that the main character is actually the richest superhero in history.","I thought that was interesting too.

What are your powers?","I can chat incessantly and make banal comments without respite. Do you have superpowers?","Wow that's impressive. Yes I raised three kids and have not gone crazy","That is impressive. you could be a superhero to dads everywhere. What other powers would you like?","Oh wow that's hard. I would like to be able to be invisible. How about you?","I would like to know the future or read peoples minds. that would be great. i would be able to see what people are thinking and freak them out.","That would be fun. You would also be able to win the lottery whenever you felt like. Kind of like the guy in back to the future.","Yeah, biff? Yes, he warnt too smart but he had the book. i could be a biff. yeah.","Don't be a Biff. Be a nice guy and help people.","Yeah, i guess i should donate some winnings to others and just keep enough for myself to live.","Very well. Did you know there was a garfield book series which featured Garfield and gang as superheroes.","Garfield is boring to me. superhero status might be funny. Yeah, i would read that.","That's what I mean. One of my favorites is the hulk. Think how great it would be be turn into a big green monster whenever someone ticked you off.","Yeah, i guess you wouldnt get invited back to parties much. plus you would have to have magical expanding jeans.

I bet we will be seeing more heores in the future,","It be cool if they made one with the Garfield Pet Force superheros, I loved that book as a kid","It would be cool I agree, Stan Lee wrote 15 comics of DC comics"],"emotion":["positive","excited","sad"]},{"dialogue":["Are you a fan of Marvel Comics?","Same here, I am a big Spider man fan. I also like the Blue Ear character","Ohh actually I never heard of the Blue Ear character before I read about it recently. It's a interesting story, what does that character do in that comics? I only know him as a character.","I believe his super power is super hearing. I hope they make a movie about him like Aqua Man","Nice. That would be interesting, I'm not sure how super hearing is going to be like, punish the bad guys? I could see it being a detective thing or something like that. Or maybe his physical power is overpowering too?","There is only one of their superhero characters that has no special powers.","Ahh, the \"normal person\" guy? I never heard of him before either. It\\'s kinda sacarstic I like that idea. Dunno how the plot is gonna go though.","I wonder how the other 300 Superheros think of him?","Lol, could be anything. Maybe they think HE is the superhero, not them. Still, how is this going to be a plot device besides daily life comady I'm not sure.","There are lots of male superheros and only a few female ones. I wonder if they will ever create a gay hero or gender neutral one","Huh, maybe. I think there's a Captain Marvel movie next year (this year?), and she is a big character (I mean, her own movie), and Black Widow I think. But I guess we can argue Black Widow is a side kick, so is Scarlett Witch.","I always had a crush on Superwoman and Catwoman","Lol why? I don't think they are Marvel, I remember they are maybe DC? I thought we are talking about Marvel. I guess I can understand Catwoman... Superwoman maybe a little weird, no offense","hard to keep the alliances straight some time. Superheros have been around since the 30's, nearly 90 years now","Yep, that's definately a long time. I think Doctor Who has been around a pretty long time too, not sure which one is longer. Makes me feel old thinking the 30s has been 90 years from now. What is alliances straight?","Hard to tell them from Marvel or DC comics","Ohh. Yeah sometimes. It's a little confusing. I didn't watch much DC stuff, so I only know pretty much Marvel stuff.","Sad that the comic world lost Stan Lee this year","Yeah, that was super sad for everybody. I heard he nearly got scammed by a young man out of his money earlier. It\\'s sad when old people get old. Did you understand the part saying he ends every phone call with \"excelsior\"? I don\\'t quite get it.","Quirky for sure."],"emotion":["positive","sad","confused"]},{"dialogue":["Do you have a favorite superhero?","Yeah, Stan Lee's creations are phenomenal! There are over 300 registered superheroes, I wonder how many of those belong to Stan?","I live in Michigan, and have been to the MSU library where they house the largest comic book collection in the world. It's pretty cool, to see in person.","Oh I didn\\'t know there was such a place! I visit Michigan often, will have to go check it out some time. Maybe I can find the character \"normalman\" in that library somewhere, did you know he existed?","Yes, I actually knew of Normalman. What I didn't know though was that Stan Lee wrote 15 DC (or Detective Comics) I always thought he was strictly a Marvel Man.","Really? Were any of those DC writings by Stan Lee made into movies? I also didn\\'t know that\\'s what \"DC\" stood for, thanks for clarifying!","I don't think the DC books were made into movies. DC can't seem to get past Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. Marvel on the other hand is willing to take risks. Marvel once created a character called Blue Ear just to help a 4 year old boy get used to wearing a hearing aid. Marvel rocks.","I know! I'm a Marvel over DC person too! I wish they'd put that character in movies because I know someone with a hearing disability as well so that would help a lot! Surprised that Disney doesn't own the rights to the well-known marvel characters in theme contracts due to a contract, so who owns the rights to them?","I know Sony owns the rights to some of Marvels characters like Venom. Marvel went through hard times back in the day and sold their rights to some characters off. They seem to be doing just fine today though making billions of dollars just with their movies.","Was it bad management that led them to hard times? Or they just simply didn't know how to market their assets? Sony once had the opportunity to purchase all the characters but only chose Spiderman, what a poor decision!","I've heard Stan Lee actually didn't run the business smoothly back in the day. He turned the reins over long ago. He got to busy making movie cameos. Stan liked to end every phone conversation by using his catch phrase - Excelsior!!!","Stan Lee needs to focus on his creative and artistic talent! Not only does he make cameos in movies, I also enjoy trying to find his signatures on Marvel characters when in theme parks. I think Marvel found a great home in Disney!","Yes Disney will do great, they still don't own the rights to everything though like the Avengers and X-men.","How does one even begin to create characters and universes like what Stan Lee did, he even created a universe that takes place in Earth-199999, which is a multiverse.","Stan was the man, but he had a lot of help from Steve Ditko and Jack Kirby. Those are three comic book legends.","Oh, I've never heard of them but they are geniuses for sure! Have you ever read the series about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheroes?","I have not read that series. I have read a lot of comics from Earth -616 which was Marvels original comic book universe.","Does it feature Garfield in that setting, there's a series spinoff named pet force that featured Garfield as the superhero.","Garfield was in Pet Force, a comic that didn't go very far. They say there are over 300 registered superheroes in the U.S.but I think that sounds kind of low.","Oh wow, I thought 300 was a lot already but considering that many series, I need to reconsider."],"emotion":["excited","positive","detailed","happy"]},{"dialogue":["hi how are you? do you like comic books?","I don't read comic books much. I sometimes see the movies.","Well comics are great sometimes, Michael Jackson even tried buying Marvel Comics once.","I guess he had the money. I wonder what he would have done with marvel.","Michael Jackson wanted to play spider-man in his own produced movie apparently.","Hm. a vanity project. I guess he could do it, but I prefer Tobey for that role.","Well, marvel refused 60 years after they started, because they began in 1939.","Yeah, that is good. Disney probably paid quite a bit for marvel, but it was worth it in my opinion.","Yes superhero movies are always profitable since it started in 1930.","Yes, the kids love them. I get tired of the sfx and the explosions. I guess I have gotten too old for them. I liked deadpool though.","Well the kids are going to be pleased to hear that there are about 30 superhero movies set to release from now to 2020.","Oh boy. well, I hope that many of them are like deadpool with the potty mouths and the sassy adult humor.","Well, I'm just hoping there is more x-men. There should be more of that.","X men seems to have a lot of installments. I don't know it very well though. Who is your favorite X man?","I don't know, there are a couple to choose from.","Wolverine? Professor X? I don't know them well.","Those are both pretty good, maybe instead of movies, I can read more comic books about them.","Well, maybe ill take another look at the xmen movies. Anyway, great chat!","I should also take a look at other groups such as the avengers sometime. Have a nice day or night!","Have a great weekend!","You too!"],"emotion":["negative","positive","humorous"]},{"dialogue":["Hello, How are you today? Do you enjoy superhero's?","Yes, I enjoy the superhero movies too! Do you have a favorite?","I like them all, honestly. Although there is a comic series where it's strictly centered around repairing all the collateral damage superheroes created I want to read hopefully soon!","Oh really, that sounds very interesting! I think my favorite would be Catwoman!! lol","That\\'s awesome! Are you also a fan of Stan Lee? Did you know he actually ends every phone call with the word \"excelsior\"? Ha!","I heard of that! lol1 Did you know they have a superhero called Blue Ear? It came from a 4 year old boy who had to wear uncomfortable hearing aids. I love that!! So cute, he told his mom superhero's don't wear hearing aids.","That is a very cute story. I wouldn't mind reading that one! I mentioned Stan Lee previously, did you also know he actually wrote 15 DC comics including Batman and Superman?","I love that! There is also a superhero called Normal man, have you heard of that?","I have, actually! Normalman was the only normal person on a planet full of superheroes. It's a very interesting concept, isn't it?","Yes, I like it! Did you know that Michigan State library has the largest collection of comic books?","Wow! I'd love to visit Michigan State just for that reason, then! I also think it's awesome that Marvel published a generic comic book just to trademark the names supervillain and superhero! Ha! That was smart of them!","Very true! Have you heard of the character Access? Its purpose is to keep separate both Marvel and DC.","I have not but that's interesting! Speaking of DC, did you know that it stands for Detective Comics, which the name is pretty much redundant? Ha!","Yes, I knew that, good way to remember especially for children. Have you seen the movie Wonder Woman yet?","I know who the character is and I think she's amazing! I also think it's amazing the Marvel branding began way back in 1961 the year they launched the Fantastic Four! Lee, Ditko, Kirby and others really took comics to the next level!","That's interesting, I like the Fantastic Four!! I love the Pet Force with Garfield, he makes me laugh just looking at him!","Ha! Well did you know about the Garfield book series spin-off named Pet Force? It featured Garfield and his gang as superheroes! I bet that was hilarious too!","Yes, that's what I meant Pet Force!! love it. Did you know in 1941 Wonder Woman was placed in the justice society as a secretary?","Was she really? That's wild as she's come a long way since then! I also think it's wild that Disney doesn't own the rights to the big named Marvel characters in theme parks east of the Mississippi! Apparently it's because of a contract Marvel and Universal Studios signed back in the 90s!","Yes, I remember when that happened! I go to the Universal park and Disney World alot! The new Wonder Woman in the new movie actually served 2 years as a soldier!! Good chat!!","That's pretty cool! Boy, she's been around since close to the time Marvel started back in 1939 as Timely Publications! Ha! Well it was good chatting with you! Hope you have a great day, friend!","You too! Yeah was the highest grossing WW1 movie!!","That is amazing! Well, I'm off to research Famous Funnies which was the first modern comic book released in the US back in 1933! Take care, friend!"],"emotion":["happy","positive"]},{"dialogue":["Hi there do you like Marvel Comics?","Yeah I like Marvel. The only comic I like from DC is Batman actually. I remember when Marvel was purchased by the Disney Company in 2009. That seems like so long ago","Disney has made so many superhero movies, I cannot keep track of them all.","Nope it's just too much at this point. Funny that Marvel had offered in 1998 to all of its characters to Sony for only 25 million dollars period that was a blunder by Sony to not buy the whole thing","I guess Sony wasn't hungry for stories. Once the Internet got going, the characters could be used for all kinds of entertainment. $25 mill is nothing.","Yep I agree. That's why they only decided to purchase Spider-Man for 10 million. They thought he was the only character that audiences cared about. Oh how wrong they were","If you can make a Spiderman movie for a profit, there should be other movies that can be made. The executives are not creative. They don't understand narrative, just dollars.","Yep that's what I think too. I guess there is actually a character that is shared between Marvel and DC. His name is access. All he does is keep both companies universes separate which I think is a noble goal haha","That would be an odd job to have. What if you fail? Who fires you? And who pays you? Both Marvel and DC? I have questions.","These are great questions haha. Did you hear about the Marvel superhero blue ear?","Blue ear? No I didn't. Is he movie-worthy?","Well apparently Marvel created blue ear for an eight-year-old boy who was wearing a hearing aid. It was to help him feel better about wearing a hearing aid because he said that superheroes don't wear hearing aids. Therefore, when Marvel heard that they created one that does","That's a great aid to a young fan. Good for them!","Yep I think that was very Noble. Are there any comic books that you currently read? I guess the first comic book was made in 1933","I don't read comics now. I was interested as a kid.","I like them as a kid too. I guess in real life Stan Lee would end every phone conversation he ever had with the word Excelsior!","Stan the Man! He had a way about him. Much better than Jim Davis. Garfield? Was there ever a funny one?","Haha that's a good point. I never got Garfield but I thought he was ok I guess. Did you know that DC in DC Comics stands for Detective Comics","That's a bit redundant. Anyway, I gotta go. I have a job as Normalman on a planet full of superheroes.","Great I'll keep an eye out for blue ear too haha. And check out the Michigan State University comic book Library"],"emotion":["enthusiastic","positive","conversational"]},{"dialogue":["Are you a superhero fan?","I missed that one, but I caught Deadpool 2 this summer.","I have not seen that one but Marvel makes a lot of good stuff. Sony should have bought Marvel when they had the chance","They really should have. So man companies pass up and it ends up being a huge mistake.","I love the fact that Marvel created a superhero who needed hearing aids specifically for a little boy","Aww. It always touches me when big name companies do thing like that. It helps kids out so much.","For sure. I think its funny that there is a character that is owned by both marvel and dc","Which one is that?","Its name is access - its whole purpose is to keep the 2 companie's universes separate","Wow. Did you know Marvel argued that Mutants are not human to pay a lower rate on x men toys instead of the higer rate for dolls?","That seems like a good plan to me! Save money where you can. I like reading these characters in comic books as well as movies","Me too. I like how they were all misfits of a sort and finally found their place.","Marvel is pretty smart - they published a generic comic book so they could trademark names like superhero","and supervillian too. That was brilliant of them.","I should have attended Michigan State - their library has a huge comic book collection","I bet that would be cool to visit, but they wouldnt let people check too many things out though. I bet they have some rare things.","For Sure - some old dc comics - did you know dc stands for detective comics","Thats a bit redundant isnt it? LOL","just a bit.. Is that a Stan lee one? He is quite the character","He was indeed, ended each phone convo with Excelsior!","Yes - there are different multiverses in his books!"],"emotion":["positive","informative","interested"]},{"dialogue":["Good morning! Do you like Marvel movies\/comics?","Same here! I learned recently that marvel started way back in 1939! I had no idea!","Really!! That is a long time ago. Do you know who acquired Marvel Entertainment?","That I do know because of all of the uproar about it. It's Disney, right?","You're correct. It was the Walt Disney Company. Do you happen to know who created The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles?","I assume it was Stan Lee. I just always thought he did all of it.","It was Stan Lee among others like Steve Ditko and Jack Kirby.","I'm not familiar with those two. Hey, speaking of Disney a bit ago. Did you hear about them not owning the rights to show big marvel characters in theme parks?","No I didn't. I also read somewhere that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel Comics in early 90s.","I didn't know that! Do you know why he didn't?","He did it so that he could play spider-man in his own movie.","Oh! That would have been interesting to see. It's odd that he failed though. Marvel tried to sell movie rights of almost all of it's characters to Sony back in 1998 but they said no.","I guess the deal fell through between the two companies. I didn't know this","Yeah, Marvel wanted $25 million. Sony rejected that and just bought the rights to Spiderman for $10 million because they thought people only cared about him.","I didn't know this. Thanks. Did you know that DC comics paid $130 for the exclusive rights to superman?","Nope, but I'd say they got a heck of a deal! Superman has probably made them tons of money!","Yes. Superman did make them a lot of money indeed.","I heard that dc from dc comics stands for detective comics.","Wow!!! That is very interesting. I didn't know this.","Something else that's interesting, at least to me that is, is that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world!

Have a great day!"],"emotion":["informative","interesting","positive","happy"]},{"dialogue":["Good morning.","The recent passing of Stan Lee is sad.","I agree! I was never super into comics, but he was absolutely legendary for what he accomplished. It's awful to hear about the allegations of elder abuse though.","Yes it is. He seemed so devoted to his wife, she helped him build his empire.","I can't imagine how heartbreaking it was for him to lose her, especially since they were together for seven decades. It's not surprising that everything seemed to go downhill after that.","The person taking care of him was arrested for filing a false claim. He was taking advantage or his age and health.","That's awful! It's disgusting how someone could take advantage of someone because they're old and senile. It's horrible the way they isolated him from his friends and loved ones toward the end of his life.","Did you know Marvel comics started in 1939!","Oh my god! That's insane. I had no idea they'd been around this long! And it doesn't look like they're going anywhere, I heard 30 superhero movies were set to be released between 2016-2020.","That is amazing. Stan Lee used to end all his phone conversations with the word \"excelsior\"","That's adorable! You know, I wonder if he regrets selling the rights to Superman for only $130.","He has made so much, I am not sure if he regrets. There is a superhero called normalman!","Now that\\'s hilarious!

I love reading them and watching all the movies. Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection.","Cool! Which Superhero is your favorite? I had no idea!

I'm glad they didn't sell to him.","Ha. I was going to say the same about Jason Momoa DId you know Stan Lee wrote 15 DC comics.","Wow, I had no clue.

I find that interesting.","Yes and I think the best thing about his Creations were that they were always very relatable characters and not over-powered","Something I find funny is DC comics is Detective Comics comics. Wonder how that got through corporate?","That is funny that that is what it stands for. What do you think about Marvel Comics though? Did you know Sony rejected an offer to buy all of the rights to Marvel Comics for only 25 million dollars","I like Marvel, they've been around since 1939. They have a lot of cool characters like Captain America and the Hulk.

I am assuming it is for copyright reasons.","Yeah that's a good question. What do you think about the superhero blue ear? It was made specifically for a deaf child","Never heard of it to be honest, sounds interesting. I do know of one called access who is a joint collaboration between DC and Marvel.","Yeah you're right, that character can go between both sets of universes, the other thing I love about Stanley is that you will end every phone call with the word Excelsior, I miss him","Well this whole superhero craze took off with Iron Man in 2008.

I do like the movies though, Black Panther was really good. Stan Lee created him of course.","Are black panther was pretty good, what do you think about the idea of Garfield as a superhero though","Why not? He's got pals, I think it would be pretty funny. Garfield always struck me as lazy though.","Yeah maybe that's his superpower is laziness LOL. they have a superhero named normalman so I don't think garfield would be a huge stretch","Well ever since 1939 when it was named Timely Publications, Marvel has been making comics and now they are owned by the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world so they must have done something right.","I agree with you.

The cowboy movie with Billy Crystal is City Slickers and was filmed in the 90s.","Whoops, I don't think I've seen the mel Brooks film. Is it any good?","Oh yeah it is a classic, but it is wacky\/absurd style of comedy. If you don't like that style, you will be angry that it got 3 nominations.","Interesting. I don't think those awards mean anything anyways.","You are kind of right, Eminem won more Oscars than Georges Lucas,Bill Murray and Leonardo DeCaprio combined.","This is interesting. What did he win them for, do you know?","He did a movie. Maybe he won one for that, but most of them would be for best song.","Interesting. I was wondering if it was for 8 Mile.

Usually I just check on who won though, are you going to check on that? You ever watch movies at all","I don't usually check - will probably see the winners on facebook. I like to watch movies and tv shows on hulu or netflix. Pretty cool taht the Academy Awards have been around since 1930 when it was broadcasted on the radio.","I think that's pretty cool too. And their first TV broadcast was back in 1953. It's interesting that they are the largest and oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony, I wonder what other countries watch them? Maybe France or something does","Have you seen the latest Wonder Woman movie?","Yes I saw that. It took place in World War 1, which is very unusual setting for movie I think. What did you like about it? Personally I thought it was ok","Sounds interesting - I haven't seen it, but I would like to. Gal Gadot served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces, I was surprised to learn.","That is interesting. I think that all Israeli citizens have to do that though. And yes, that movie is the highest grossing superhero origin movie, and also highest grossing World War One movie. They should make more World War 1 movies I think","Oh I didn't know that about Israeli citizens. I agree about making more WW1 movies.","I guess in 2017 that was the Year where are the top three most successful movies were all led by females, that makes sense though, that's the year that Star Wars and Beauty and the Beast and Wonder Woman all came out","Have you seen Star Wars or Beauty and the Beast? I've only seen Beauty and the Beast.","I have seen both of those. I really hated the Star Wars movie. I thought they ruined Luke Skywalker. And I thought Beauty and the Beast was ok, I think that they just stole everything from the cartoon version, and it was almost exactly the same, except they made new additions that were not as good, what do you think?","I thought it was just okay too. I was kind of disappointed with some of the special effects - like the character of Lumiere didn't look right to me.","Yeah I agree with you he looks weird in the movie. It's funny that Gal Gadot thought she was testing for the role of Catwoman. That is a completely different role LOL","Yeah that is not even close, haha.","Pretty funny how times have changed so in terms of female representation. When she was a member of the Justice Society, and that was back in 1941, I guess they made her a secretary LOL definitely not an acceptable way to show her nowadays","Yes times have changed for sure. Pretty crazy that the sun can produce energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500000 years.","That is impressive. I wish we could harness that somehow, that would really help save the planet I think. It's all so crazy that the sun is actually white, you're always taught in school that it's yellow, but that's because of our atmosphere","Yeah that is cool. And it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy.","It seems small, but the sun is actually huge, the diameter is 110 times the size of Earth, that's crazy because the Earth is already huge in my opinion haha"],"emotion":["positive","informative","happy","awe"]},{"dialogue":["did you know that Wonder Woman is the top grossing super hero origin movie? I didn't know that","See I like Batman as my favorite overall superhero, so he is DC, but I can't say I'm a fan of the rest of the DC characters, they seem too unbelievable, who are your favorite DC characters?","I grew up with Superman comics. Such a powerful superhero makes the writers have to come up with preposterous villains though. It is interesting that Gal Gadot was really a soldier for Israel.","Yes that definitely adds more legitimacy to her character, but I do think eveery Israeli is required by law to serve in the military, but that still is an interesting fact","Her first movie was Batman (your guy) vs Superman (my guy) in 2016. She signed for 3 movies in her first contract which kept her price low.","haha I like that, your guy vs my guy, what did you think of that movie? I still like Christopher Reeve as the best Superman, Superman 1 and 2 are really good movies still, can't say I'm too thrilled with the current Superman movies","It was a watchable movie. I agree with Reeve as Superman. 2017 was the first year since 1958 that the top 3 grossing domestic films had a female lead.","ya that is shocking, you mentioned Gal Gadot, I guess when she auditioned for wonder woman she thought it was originally a try out for catwoman, which would have been a much different movie haha","When the character was introduced to the Justice League, they made her be the secretary. That would not fly in the climate of political correctness of today.","oh no not at all, it's crazy how quickly times change, I also think its crazy that Wonder Woman was the highest grossing WWI movie, you don't see too many movies based on that war","That is true. It is also interesting that one of the producers was a Chinese company. I suspect that somehow helped the film appear on more screens in China.","haha yes I defnitely that that factored into it, do you liek Daniel Day-Lewis, I can't believe that he won an oscar for best actor 3 times, that is crazy","He does what he does well. They have been giving Oscars since 1929. This year there will not be a host because of political correctness.","did they not pick a host now? I know they changed it from Kevin Hart or something, I try not to read the news because it is too depressing and exhausting, I like random facts like how a lightening bolt is five times hotter than the surface of the sun haha","No. They are going without a host. I cannot conceive of a star one billion times as large as our sun, yet one exists in our galaxy.","what is wild too is that the sun makes enough energy in one second to meet our planet's needs for 500,000 years, I don't see how we can't capture some of that","Surely future generations will get better at doing that. It is clearly the most important energy source in our solar system.","yes the future will definitely improve our technology, I think it's wild that the sun is actually white, it's just because of our atmosphere that it appears yellow in the sky","I agree. I thought it was yellow because it was not as hot as a white star but is hotter than a red one. How about Neptune only orbiting the sun once since it was discovered?","Yes that seems odd, I wonder if we will get to visit any of these distant planets in our lifetime, what do you think?"],"emotion":["knowledgeable","positive","curious"]},{"dialogue":["Did you know that dog's have 12 different blood types, and that they can donate blood at blood drives for dogs?","I have a dog, he's not much of a physical help, but he's emotional support.

I do wish they could pick up us talking lol","My dog is lazy like me, like right now he's just sitting in my chair with me. I wish my dog could talk sometimes just so I could know what he wanted instead of just staring at me.","lol same. Or if they could sing, when I do play music my dog barks in rhythm. Any time I listen to Bruno Mars he loves it... you like his music?","That's awesome. Mine just looks at me weird when I sing. I do like music though, I'm always listening to it.","I love how he writes some of the best songs. interesting to know he use to be with Motown. Love that label.","He's very talented and he writes his own music, that speaks a lot for his talent.","He started off as an Elvis, which i have seen on youtube. very interesting to see. Maye he will go to Mars on that reality show lol","He could be the host of it!","hahah Totally! and play all the music on the planet.","He could wrestle people since he was named after professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.","hahaha that would be entertaining too. dont forget about the dog, it has to be there to trying to sing ad being a helped paw hand lol","That would be epic!

They even state in their code of conduct that they are a dog company.","That is pretty cool. I also like what istanbul is doing with their stray dogs, they are training them to pick up garbage and then they will get food once they deliver the garbage to the recycling center","That's a great idea! Did you know that dogs are not color blind? They just can't see as many different colors as humans.","No I didn't know that. I wonder why people say that all the time. On a different note though, do you ever think about the planet Mars? It's the red planet in our solar system","I do. It's also the fourth planet from the sun and the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury.","Yes you're right. It's also crazy that if you and I were there right now our voices would be higher-pitched because of the difference in the atmosphere on Mars vs. Earth","Interesting! Lichens and cyanobacteria would be able to thrive on Mars.","It is interesting. It's also interesting that they are trying to plan a Mars colonization project that will be funded by a reality show, I really want to see that!","That would be fun to watch. A satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system while NASA used the metric system.","Haha that is funny. I remember when that happened. It's also crazy that if we could just travel at one unit of gravity acceleration then we could get to Mars in 2 days, I hope we can do that in our lifetime","That would be awesome!

He was signed and dropped by Motown records years before becoming a success.","Well that is cool. And he was also named after a professional wrestler, bruno sammartino","That is neat!

Great learning tool. It will be far more engaging for the students to learn with the headset vs staring at a class on their computer screen as well.","I agree. I remember being so bored and distracted during class, and now students have social media to distract them.

So did Chadwick Boseman. I didn't know the Black Panther is the wealthiest fictional Marvel Universe character","I didn't realize that either. I figured Tony Stark would have been richer.","Yep that's what I would have thought, the Black Panther is worth about 500 billion, Iron Man is worth about 100 billion, and Bruce Wayne is worth about 80 billion","Did you know that Marvel's use of the name actually predates the founding of the Black Panther Party?","I always wondered where that came from. And I guess they also tried changing the name of the character for a while so that it wasn't associated with that group, but that didn't work obviously haha","Yeah they had changed it to \"Black Leopard,\" that just doesn\\'t seem as fitting as Black Panther.","Nope it doesn't sound as good, it's pretty cool that Denzel Washington helped out Chadwick Boseman back in the day, and then Chadwick gave him a shout-out at the premiere","That is pretty cool. Did you know that the symbols and written script featured in the movie are based on an actual script called Nsibdi?","Wow that's good attention to detail, Marvel Comics is interesting though. Back in 1998 they were trying to sell all of their characters to Sony for only 25 million dollars, Sony thought that was a bad idea because no one cared about any other character but Spider-Man, and they only got Spider-Man for 10 million, they must be kicking themselves now haha","Oh wow, that was a bad move on Sony\\'s part. I learned that they successfully argued in court that mutants are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on X-Men \"toys\" instead of the higher rate for dolls.","oh interesting. So that was what was going on with that. do you know the backstory of the superhero blue ear by chance?","Yeah I heard about that. It was a very sweet thing they did for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids. He told his mom that \"superheroes don\\'t wear hearing aids\" so marvel created one.","Yep that is super nice of them I think. Isn't it weird that in Mississippi, Disney does not own the rights to show the big Marvel characters like X-Men and Spider-Man, apparently they have a custom contract with Universal Studios in that specific state","It's actually parks East of the Mississippi, so I'm guessing mostly Disney World in Orlando.","I must have read that wrong lol, do you like DC Comics or Marvel Comics more by the way? Personally I like Batman from DC, but the rest I am all Marvel","I'm more of a Marvel fan, but I do like a few DC characters though.","Yep I agree with you there. Is that funny that Marvel published a\"generic comic book\" so that they could trademark the terms superhero and supervillain","That's pretty interesting.

Interesting note, I did read that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel Comics so he could play Spiderman in his own movie.","Really? That would have been interesting. I wonder if he would have put dance scenes in the movie!","I'm sure he would have, no doubt! Just found out today that Google had purchased gmail.com from the Garfield comics!

Then again, I don't remember much more than Garfield and lasagna!","I always thought gmail stood for google mail? Lol. Talk about a good deal, I hear that DC comics paid $130 for Superman in 1938.","I thought it did too btw. So are you saying that dc owned spiderman at one time?","So, it would seem? Who knows Marvel Comics spent a decade trying to prove to the government that the Xmen were not real. It's a wacky universe, we love in!","Yes it is! Marvel published a generic comic book of sorts at one time. They did that so they could trademark the names suepr-hero and super-villain.","That was SUPER smart of them to do that!

Marvel takes their movies to a different super hero universe than in the comics. I guess that's how they can make the story lines different in both and keep things going.","Speaking of the universe, do you know our universe used to be completely opaque?","No I didn't. So our universe used to look like fog, or thick white clouds?","Yes, apparently, there was so much plasma that the light couldn't get through. Don't ask me how the scientists determined this fact!","Lol! I won't but I do wonder! Scientists have some strange ideas some times. I've heard that there are some that think our universe is just one giant hologram.","I've heard that one, as well as that the universe exists inside a black hole or that a cold spot in the cosmic radiation could be an indication that it is a link to a parallel universe.

Do you know how many comic books they have there?","I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t been to that campus. Its funny that marvel published a generic comic book, so they could trademark \"super hero\" and \"super villain\".","That doesn't sound fair to trademark those words because they seem very commonly used words.","I guess the government felt differently. Stan Lee ends each phone call with Excelsior, and his tweets as well. I miss him.","He was a true legend in his field. He even re-imagined classics like Batman and Superman","I remember that. He did a better job than their original creators.","I was surprised to learn recently that the American comics only has roughly 10% of the world market.","Did you hear about the controversy over an actor playing Batwoman? They were trashing her because she isn\\'t \"gay enough\". I never knew Batwoman was a lesbian.","Wow, i did not know that either. I don't see what the big deal is, I mean you can always have different actors with different interpretations of the same character. It makes it more interesting.","The actress IS a lesbian though. She came out at 12. People are so weird.","A lot of people are social justice warriors who feel that their viewpoint is always the right viewpoint.

I think Michelle Williams was in Dawson's Creek and it seems like I've heard she's in Venom too.","I don't know all of the superheroes but there is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheroes.","Yeah? That would be cool to see in a movie. They could make it a comedy of sorts. Speaking of superheroes did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the United States?","No I didn\\'t until now. As a funny twist, there is a \"Normalman\" superhero with no powers on a planet full of superheroes with powers!","That would be funny! It would make a good movie too! Seems like I heard that all of this superhero stuff started back in the 1930s.","That is true. Stan Lee created 15 DC comics. He recently pasted away so he did live to see them made into movies.","That's good that he lived long enough to see that.

Imagine how good Michael Keaton's could have done if he had a sequel Then there probably would have been a theme park at Universal Studios for Batman.","George Clooney and Val Kilmer also played Batman in other Batman movies","Yes they did. Say, did you know that there were plans to make the Green Lantern into a comedy?","I didn't know that. Smallville was originally meant to tell the story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.","Really?

They were a great band, I wish I couldve saw them too.","Yeah, their debut album was great I really liked it, another band I used to like was Creed.","I dont think I know who they are. Any good? what are some of their songs?","Some of their best songs are \"My Sacrifice\" and \"Higher\" you should look them up, too bad the band started having problems, in 2002 they gave a concert that wasn\\'t up to their usual standards.","Oh right, their fans filed a lawsuit, that is unfortunate.

I never would have thought that.","There were many games that were derivative from the Indian game of Chaturanga","Oh really?

I guess birds just have a way of making people feel better.","They have a beautiful voice, but sometime they can mimic sounds of car alarms and chainsaws.

Some even migrate from Alask all the way to Mexico without sleeping. Thats amazing.","I wonder how many days the trip is.

They are amazing how fast they flap. Most birds bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers.","I love to watch vultures high in the sky as they fly in circles for hours without flapping their wings.

I can't believe Stephen King thought Bambi was a horror movie.","I saw the movie the Shining I believe. Disney movies have been creepy at times. I could see how Bambi losing his mother in a fire could be horrific! They say that if you watch a horror movie before viewing abstract art, you'll enjoy the art more.

It will still have the basics im sure, such as Icobod Crane. I remember him being kind of a wuss in the original.","Haha I think he was kind of a wuss as well. In this interpretation he's kind of a thug and hangs out with a bunch of army guys. I guess they toughened him up a bit.","They also made a play about Edgar Allen Poe called Nevermore. It was a musical","Hmm interesting. It's good to know that Texas has theater. I had no idea. Prices aren't bad either.","Texas theatre might be a little less stuck up than other theatre communities.

It's crazy to that the Ramones played 2200 concerts in about 20 years, I would definitely check them out as well","How rich are they? They must be rolling in dough. The fans must love them to support 20 years of touring. I guess new fans have appeared every generation.","Oh they're definitely loaded LOL. I really would like to see a concert in the ancient Roman Amphitheatre, it's still being used today and it's in Croatia","I think that's great! I wonder how comfortable the seats are though. The acoustics must be interesting as well. I wonder if the Ramones ever played there.","I wonder that too! Would you ever see Creed in concert? I read that they were sued because people were displeased with their concert","I wonder if the fans won their lawsuit, or if the band settled. The case may have had merit, in which case I wouldn't be surprised if the band decided to stop recording and touring.","I know right lol they should take that as a hint haha.

I can't believe you haven't heard the song Let It Go, that was like a huge song on that movie first came out, and apparently they changed the main character to go with that song so that she was good instead of being evil, because she was going to be evil initially","I guess I'm old and out of touch! LOL. I think that it must have been a powerful song for them to change the character around that way.","I need to see the movie. Just to let you catch up with the times maybe haha.

In 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band. I hope the dogs didn't sue Lou Reed.","Yeah that sounds pretty sad, it sounds like they didn't like the show, so don't buy another ticket, simple.","I guess, but maybe they felt cheated and wanted to teach the band a lesson. I've been to bad concerts, but a lawsuit is a lot of headache and time.","Yeah same here, and to me there are too many people suing too many other people these days.","In Croatia, there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue.

I guess that's the Batman that Stan Lee re-imaged when he worked on DC stuff.","I havent watched that one I might look it in Youtube later, Stan Lee did write 15 dc comics reimagining superheroes.","There is one character the DC and Marvel both own.

Doctor Strange's character originated as Sir Isaac Newton in the Marvel universe","I see, Doctor Strange is one of my favorite heroes, you know Michael Jackson wasnt the only one interested in the rights of Spiderman apparently Sony was too and bought the rights, Marvel offered all the other characters for 25 million and Sony thought they were worthless","Little did they know. Marvel has even trademarked the names \"super-hero\" and \"super-villain\"","I wonder if DC comics has to pay them everytime they use those names in any of their movies or stories","It may depend on the context of its use. Many of the superheroes that are popular today are a result of an experiment Stan Lee did when he was planning on changing careers. I'm glad he didn't","Im glad he didnt as well, he surely made a big contribution to general culture, its too sad he died.","I know. He's definitely changed the way we view superheroes. Marvel wouldn't be where it is now without him.

He's definitely been a key player in the genre we know as superhero fiction","I think Marvel and DC have a good relationship, there is a character owned by both franchises.","Maybe now, but the character of Captain Marvel has a long history of different variations.

I'm generally pretty easily entertained when it comes to movies. How about you?","I tend to read them because its always nice to see things from different perspectives. For instance, a chicago tribune state that a the real mess of a movie was much more thrilling that the formulaic superhero movies all year prior.","There are definitely a lot of bad reviews out there for Venom. One of the harshest reviews called it \"a disaster on every level\"","Well bad movies aren't too bad. I mean there are movies like the elevator that are so bad that people watch it to laugh at how bad it really is.","Ha, that's true, cause Ishtar is also a fantastic movie.

It is too bad that some people felt that venom existed as a waste of time","I think it's impossible to please everyone. Hopefully the people that made the movie liked it. While some people are down on the Spiderman series, I actually liked some of the more recent movies.","I personally really enjoyed the most recent Spiderman Spiderverse.

Like catching the ball in your hat gives the other team three bases.","You know I think Pete Rose played a few games while he was a manager but Pete was one crazy dude","You might be right about that. He would never admit to being too old to play. My daughter lives just down the street from Fenway park in Boston. One of the two 100 year old parks.","I've been to Fenway once, it's pretty crazy their first game was against the NY Highlanders","Those Highlanders became the Yankees in 1913 so that does make 100 years. That club started as the Baltimore Orioles in 1901. I bet there were some odd rules back then.","I'm sure, speaking of odd 2 yankee pitchers swapped families in 1973","Wow! that\\'s really \"Trading places\". One thing I don\\'t like about the Yankees is they don\\'t have names of their uniforms. I guess they are supposed to be so famous that everyone knows them. Although the club claims that\\'s to emphasize the team element of the game.","I guess that\\'s a major reason why there is a \"lost\" yankee player","You mean some kind of ghost? Baseball is full of stories, like how the Sox name came from Noah Webster's plan to simplify spelling. Boston and Chicago bought in anyway.","I figured it was just because people in Boston and Chicago have horrible accents, especially Boston saying sox instead of socks lol","Yeah, especially Boston. Can hardly understand some of them. When I play video baseball game with my boy he always wants to be the Albuquerque Isotopes. That name was actually made up for the Simpson's show. I prefer the Birmingham Biscuits. We have a lot of fun.","You ever play soccer-baseball aka kickball?","No since 3rd grade! But my grown up hipster daughter and her friends do. I guess it also involves beer.

I heard some guy found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cars in his grandfathers attic.","Wow that would be an awesome find! In season of MLB baseball, they can go through 160,000 baseballs.","That's a lot of baseballs. I wonder how many bats they go through?","I bet not nearly as many bats. They don't seem to break very often.","I heard baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their team. I would love to see that.","I have heard that too. Have you ever seen a manager play before?","No, I would pay to see one of them step up to the plate.","I would love to see that too.

Cool, a relaxed team.","I think the wives must have been ok with it if it was permanent.","One of the managers of the Washington Nationals they would get better. He was right. He would also be right in saying a coin lands on head or tails.","That is tru he was. The yankees actually began play in 1901 as the baltimore orioles.","So the New York Yankees played as the Baltimore Oreo's. Thats pretty strange. Was it the bird, or the cookie that came first.","I would say in history the Bird probably came first. Lol. The yankees have a lost player. Im gonna have to do some research on that.

It got him season tickets to the yankees so hey give it a try.","I would like to try. There are so many statistics about baseball. Its nauseating. The Red Sox have lost every game on Ben Afflecks birthday since they forgot how to spell socks.","Did you know that the new york time in part owns the red sox.","So, that means that a new york newspaper prints articles about a baseball team. truly the end of the world that is. A dying media owning a physical team. If only they owned a virtual team.","Lol. Did you know that baseball managers are allowed to play in the game thats why they wear a uniform.

I know the first game they played in fenway park they 7-6 beat the new york islanders","Really? fascinating.

He was a comedy genius, but not so good at science.","Oh ok, that makes more sense now. I don't think electric violins are as popular as the traditional violins, which one do you like more?","Traditional ones seem appropriate for most settings.

After getting a late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 12 , reed started netflix.","What a terrible revenue of $40. But for that $40, they would still be in business!","Maybe, but did you know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.","That's a ton. Why so much?","Well Netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in North America. That is why!","That's crazy! I guess videos do take up more bandwidth.","Yes!

Oh wow, the guy had so much talent it seems","yup. Did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week?","Wow that is a lot of money too. In the show Mr. Rogers , in an episode he learns to breakdance","Nice, I want to see that. Did you know Jackson has a patent in a device that helps to achieve smooth dance moves?","I wonder what happened to it now that he is no longer with us","Hmm good questions actually. Did you know Tupac was also a dancer?","He was? What kind of dance did he participate in?","He was actually a ballet dancers, I know it seems off but he was","Hmm interesting. Parrots are really good at dancing in tune with music","Nice babies too they tend to dance when they hear music","Yeah that is sweet. There are some ballet shoes that make drawings based on how the dancers move","Nice I want a pair of those too, not that I am a great dancer or anything but yeah","The first moonwalk dance was done by Bill Bailey in 1955","Wow I thought it was a Jackson thing this whole time.

Were you aware that as of 2018 the franchise was estimated to be worth $65 billion making it the fifth highest grossing media franchise? That's a lot of money.","I didn't know that. It is alot of money. Funny James Earl Jones only got $7500 for recording all of Darth Vader's lines for Star Wars.","That's crazy! I was not aware of that. His voice is so iconic to the franchise.","Yeah, it is. I can't imagine anybody else doing Darth Vader but him.","Me either. Did you know that Star Wars has even been dubbed in Navajo?","I had heard that, it's very popular movie so I guess it's been dubbed in many languages. Did you realize that 20th Century Fox was convinced it was going to be a flop?","I had heard that. I believe Lucas made a deal to get merchandising rights because of that?","Yes, he did. Such a smart man. He agreed to forgo an additional $500,000 directing fee in return to keep the licensing and merchandising rights for himself.","Wow?! The merchandising for that franchise is big business. People are insane about collecting it. That was an incredibly good business decision on his part.","It made him a billionaire and cost Fox billions. I bet they kick themselves about that decision all the time. Lol","Oh I'm positive that they do. It's off topic but do you enjoy any country music?","Why I sure do. Do you?","I like the older stuff like Patsy Cline or Johnny Cash. Did you know that George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins?!","How interesting, both of them so successful and rich from different industries. I didn't know that there were only 2 African Americans in the Country music Hall of Fame. Did you?","It is very interesting. I did not know that. I'm honestly surprised there are any. I can't think of any African American country artists.","I was thinking Charley Pride, but that was the only one I could come up with. I know there are more in Country Music nowadays, though.","I must admit that I am not very knowledgeable about the modern artists. Were you aware that Henry Ford helped popularize country music by financing it because he was afraid of the \"urban decadence\" of jazz music?","I did't know Henry Ford had his hand in Country music. I can believe the urban decadence of Jazz, though. Did you know Clint Eastwood is a lifelong Jazz enthusiast, pianist, and has scored several films?","I did not. I took him for more of a country guy."],"emotion":["positive","informative"]},{"dialogue":["I am a huge star wars fan. Have you ever seen them?","It is amazing how much a pop culture phenom it has become. I wonder if the actors or george lucas had any idea way back in 1977","no way, the value has gone up to a whopping 65billion! back then he was just making a space movie, now its a phenom","So true. There is even epic series of books that give back story and what the future was after the original trilogy. I have to admit that having read the books I was rooting for them to pull from those but they didn't","oh you read the old extended universe stuff? Like with Han and Leia's kids before Kylo Ren was a thing?","Yes! I was so hoping that when they introduced Rey she was going to be the girl twin and that Luke was off living happily with Mara Jade and his son ben but nope.","I had read about a lot of people speculating thats what they were gonna do with the plot, but would that have been too obvious? I dont mind the route they took, I still really like the new movies","I heard something about they wanted to expand it beyond being just a skywalker story. Which kind of makes me sad because that is really the whole point of star wars. The new movies are pretty good though. The graphics are amazing.","I heard that these 9 movies are the Skywalker Saga and everything beyond that is just cool stuff happening in the universe, which I'm all for. Like Jon Favreau is making that TV show about Mandalorian bounty hunters. I think they need to not do movies like Solo and come up with more original characters like Rogue One","It would be amazing to watch a series about the bounty hunters! I didn't mind Solo. I like getting the backstory on some of the beloved characters of the past.","I liked it too but if they want to get that magic again and if they want to stray from the Skywalker family, they need to develop a new cast of characters","And give them some depth. I don't think they developed Poe enough in the movies yet. I think he could have a really interesting backstory.","yea apparently hes gay too? And has a long lost love who taught him to be a pilot? something they never even touched on in the movies. he could be such a well developed character if they give him some more screen time","I would love to see a mini series for tv about the liberation of the kids on that casino planet. I feel like after they were visited in the third trilogy there is going to be some sort of uprising and it would make for an amazing movie.","i hope so, there should be some payoff to that planet and I think there will be. And since JJ is finishing the story he started, I feel he will end it in a satisfying way","His work is amazing. It is no wonder that he was able to secure a guinness world record for this franchise.","yea i agree. I think JJ was a big fan of Jazz music too. he wasnt alive in the 1920s during the Jazz Age, but he appreciates all of those classics","I think Jazz really speaks to the creative soul since it is so freeform. Great jazz musicians say they never know how a piece will end when they are composing.","which is crazy too me. Jazz is so complex. Tupac even went to the Baltimore School of the Arts to study it","I think Jazz has its fingers into a lot of musical pies so to speak. It is so neat how everyone thinks their own favorite music is unique but actually they all weave together."],"emotion":["positive","awe"]},{"dialogue":["Hi good morning. Do you have any kids? It seems like Incredibles 2 would be a good movie to watch with them.","Awesome. Apparently 13 years before incredibles 2 came out there was a release in video game format!","Hahaha.

But I should since it won a golden globe back in '97!","I love any kind of movies, specially a genre of movies called bromatic comedies.","Oh nice. Me too actually. One of my favorite movies was pineapple express! Seth Rogan and Franco, so funny.","It was so impressed when I found out that that the first silent movies were comedies","Yeah that is so funny, slapstick comedy is. I also like comedies because most traditionally have a happy ending. Except for the black comedy variation.","did you know that there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes?","Ha ha no I didn't know that but I always wonder what happened to the damage caused by the superheroes. Surprisingly there are over 300 registered superheroes in the United States.","Wow. I didn't know there were that many. I read something funny the other day about garfield and a book series named pet force. hahahaha","Garfield is a superhero? One superhero that doesn't sound very interesting is normal man he doesn't have any powers.","hahahha... I am not sure, but I thought it was the cat.","Yeah Garfield the cat lol! One thing I didn't know is that Stanley wrote 15 DC comics. Very surprising.","I know. They kind of were re-imagining popular superheroes like batman and superman.","Yes exactly. So cool the superhero has been around since 1930!","incredible! But there are not too many female superheroes.","That is true. I am sure Wonder Woman gets lonely sometimes!

Hes great in that show whose line is it anyways.","oh yeah, he surely makes me laugh!","Have you ever watched 3rd rock from the sun?","I love that show, i was excited when they won a golden globe award.

The hangover series especially lol","Yeah, i prefer the Harold and Kumar series better theough especiallly when all they want to do is go to \\\\White Castle haha","lol those little burgers are delicious.","Yeah they are they are little pieces of heaven in between two delectable buns.","Its been great chatting, thanks for the convo!"],"emotion":["positive"]},{"dialogue":["Hello. do you like star wars?","I agree. The older movies are much better. It is a popular series though to a lot of people. Star Wars is the second highest grossing movie of all time.","I remember being very excited when the first prequel was released, I paid to see it at the big fancy theater in DC, the Uptown","What is that theater like?","It's one of those big old theaters with just one big screen","Cool. Say, did you know that George Lucas' wife worked on the movie?","Was it how they met or were they married at the time? It's always funny that the producers had no faith in the movie before it came out.","They were married at the time. She made some major changes like obi wan's death and such and won an academy award for editing.","Good for her, still over shadowed by her husband though. With all the money they've made from the merchandising I'm sure she doesn't mind.","Probably so. Star Wars holds the record for most successful film merchandising franchise.","My son loves the Star Wars music, he's learned to play all the music on piano.","That is really impressive. I used to have the album of the sound track from the original movie back in the day. Those songs were fantastic!","I think I did too, not a hundred percent sure. My dad had Jazz playing all the time at home, I think I wanted something I liked.","I like jazz. I'm not real familiar with all of the artists but i do like the music. I especially like the swing bands of the 1930s.","I think my dad turned me away from it, you know, the more someone tries to force it on you the less likely you are to move toward it.","I know what you mean. My parents listened to a lot of country when i was a kid so I turned to rock and pop music. Now though, I do like some country I have to admit. I think George Strait is very good.","That's another mystery to me. I've lived primarily in DC and country doesn't make much of an impression there. If anything I lie the older country, Hank Williams and that.","I guess Henry Ford may have failed then. He helped finance country music back in the day due to his fears of jazz music and it's urban decadence.","People are always fearful that the new thing will lead to the end of civilization. Country is just folk music originally from Europe, Jazz is probably just folk music from a different source.","True. Jazz comes from the blues and ragtime I think."],"emotion":["positive"]},{"dialogue":["Have you been to the DC area before?","Yeah I heard about the Comic-Con that sounds like a great thing to do, also the showcase with Jenna Camille, that is another must do thing on my list","That does sound good!

Also I would go see Justin pack personally","I havent but maybe this year I can make it, one of the stands I would visit would be the Star Wars stand","I would check that out too! George Lucas is a genius to come up with that whole series of movies. Although I must say I don't like the new ones myself.","I dont like the new ones either, I loved Episode I and Episode III but Rogue One was terrible","Rogue one is horrible haha. I agree with you there. Do you like James Cameron? He was apparently inspired by Star Wars","I do, I think his a great director and movies can inspire us to take different paths, thank God James Cameron became a director thanks to the influence of Star Wars","I agree! I really like his movie Terminator and Terminator 2. What is really weird is that George Lucas says r2d2 is telling the entire story of Star Wars. only he's telling it several hundred years in the future","Thats a creative spin to the story, R2D2 is a badass, his my favorite robot so if anyone has to tell the story im glad its him and not a sith robot","Haha that's funny. What's funny to is that fox gave George Lucas merchandising rights instead of the $500,000 for part of his directing fee. And that helps to make him a billionaire LOL","It is funny, they lost a lot of money there for sure, Star Wars is a really popular franchise so yeah, did you know that in 2013 Star Wars was dubbed in navajo,","No I didn\\'t know that! I also didn\\'t know that Star Wars holds the Guinness World Records title for\"most successful film merchandising franchise\"","I guess Lucas is really happy about that and Fox is regretting it big time, Maria Lucas is really important as well, the success of the franchise is in great part due to her","I agree. She doesn't get enough credit! Do you like country music at all?","No not really, do you like it?","I can't say that I do. but I did not know that the Fender Stratocaster was intended originally for country music","I didnt know that either that is a great guitar, I love Jazz better though, find it relaxing","Yeah I think jazz is more relaxing.

It's funny, I'm studying computer programming and right now I'm learning the Python Programming language. It was named partly to honor the British comedy group Monty Python.","Interesting, I didn't know that. I have to use both Python and Java at my job. Mostly Python for the SciKit library.","That's awesome, I like learning it so far.","Yeah, it is pretty cool stuff, but repetitive.","I've caught that so far.

The answer to what do I hate more is always snakes...I can't even watch them on TV.","I'm a wuss when it comes to the cold, I can always kill snakes, but you can't kill the cold. The fear of snakes is hard-wired in our brains, so it's natural to be afraid of them.","I guess it's regional becuase I can always put on more layers. I can't run away from snakes fast enough!

But they were heavy into slapstick which stops being funny when the audience matures.","Yeah, when movies were new slapstick was enough to entertain everybody.

I'm not a massive fan of hers, but she does seem very talented so I'll have to check some of her stuff out. Do you like any other albums?

Apparently they need more money by lending their rights to the Guitar Hero franchise then buy any kind of record sales LOL that's crazy","I think that was a great idea in my opinion, guitar hero was a hit because of their contribution, thats a lot of royalties.","Yes I agree! I love playing those games when I was in high school, do you like Led Zeppelin by the way? I love that they didn't name their fourth album just to mess with the rock press, wish they hated","I never really listened to their music.

I liked the movie because it took place 10 years after \"A New Hope\" so it gave some closure.","Yeah and that's what I feel that series lacks is closure. There's too many open loops in the story line for me.","Yeah it always leaves you hanging. But there were some answered questions.

Have you ever played the video game?","Yes I did. The video game is actually really good! And shockingly it cost more than the first Deadpool movie to make","That makes sense, as it costs the video game developers a lot of money to design the graphics, and a lot more to market the game.","Do you remember in Deadpool to the mystery villain? Apparently Ryan Reynolds does his voice, I wonder who the villain is going to be in Deadpool 3 though","I wonder too. Deadpool is the highest grossing r rated film that was not directed by George Lucas or James Cameron! No wonder it was so successful","Yes I agree. You said that you like Star Wars movies right? did you know that Han Solo used to be a TIE fighter pilot?","No I did not! Han Solo was apparently also an imperial lieutenant before meeting up with Chewbacca.","Well that is interesting, also George Lucas wanted him to be a large green alien or a black man originally LOL that would have been a very different movie","I am glad that they chose for him to be a very furry person. He is one of my favorite star wars characters.","Yep I agree, I love Harrison Ford, what if they chose Christopher Walken though? He was in the running for it","I wonder what would have happened then. Maybe we should just be happy that the things are the way they are because the movie turned out to be excellent.","Yes we totally should. a lot of things came together well because if you was available, for instance Al Pacino turned down Han Solo's role because he didn't understand the script that would have been totally different too","It would have been very different. Do you think that we will ever be in a world similar to that of star wars?","No I don't think so, that world is too Fantastical I think, what do you think? I would like to travel to outer space though","Speaking of travelling. did you know that all of Japans highways have tolls? It would cost over 300$ to travel across Japan!","Yeah that sounds expensive, it would be fun to ride that Dutch Bus 160 miles per hour on those road so LOL.","I wonder if there had been many accidents with those buses because 160 mph does not sound very safe!","No thats definitely really fast.

Wise decision, in my opinion. Comedy seems to put more focus on individual stars unlike so many other genres!","Comedy lighten ups the world, did you ever watch 3rd Rock from the Sun?","I do!

Rock music is usually in 4\/4 time which gives it that driving beat.","Ahah that's funny, maybe he was the real inspiration for Sonic. Yeah rock certainly seems timeless and like it isn't changing a whole lot, the band Whitesnake has had over 50 members throughout its lifetime.","That is a lot of turnover! Most rock is about romance, but there are some tunes about political or social issues.","And I know the Beatles were one of the most influential bands in terms of covering a wide range of topics.They had the song \"Come Together\" which was actually for Timothy Leary\\'s governor campaign.","Their music \"book\" is fantastic! They were formed in 1960.","And yet somehow their music has been timeless, it was even the best selling album of the 2000's!","That is consistent with their book being fantastic.

Ringo Starr was illiterate for most of his childhood.","That's surprising although literacy doesn't necessarily mean musical talent! In fact I think that goes for all of them, I don't think any of the Beatles could read music!","I hadn't heard that. I wonder how Lennon and McCartney wrote their songs?","I wonder too! It doesn't seem like they adapted well to entertainment life beyond making music to be honest, like they stopped touring because their amplification system couldn't drown out their screaming crowds!","That is incredible! I have been in front of speakers that undoubtedly harmed my hearing permanently. Maybe it was just before better technology improved the amplification technology.","I'm sure it was! I wonder how modern tours are for artists that release new albums. Like there were two twins that released a rap album when they were 100 years old, I bet the noise would be hard to manage no matter what the technology.","LPs were old technology but it is now becoming popular again. MP3 is modern, but the quality of sound is not as good.","Definitely, but I think it's prioritized more than anything, well MP3 and CD formats, because I think the audio cassette has sort of faded out by now.","The new formats are simpler and easier to maintain.

Do you like other rock music? I like a lot of the older rock music Albums like Pink Floyds Dark side of the moon, great rock music back then.","Dark side of the moon was an amazing album. I did not know until recently that Oklahoma had a state song","Oh yeah? What is their State song? Was it sang by Flamingo Lips rock band?","It is - the song is Do you realize?","Oh, cool! I didn't know that. Also interesting that the rock band Whitesnake had over 50 band memebers throughout their history, wow that is a lot!","Wow! They must have been hard to get along with changing members so much. I am surprised that the biggest rock star in Russian history kept his job working in the boiler room","Right? Wow, I wonder why he kept that job if he was a big rock star? I would run from that lol. Maybe they didn't have a lot of Albums.","That is funny. There are two identical twins from japan who released their first album at 100 years old. Not sure how long their career will be!","Oh my! Good for them! Most people never get to have their album known, much less at that age!","Yes. The first albums were released in the early 20th century - they might have been around for them!","I am sure they were!

That was back in 1969","Well, maybe at the time Tim Leary seemed like a reasonable candidate to the Beatles. They liked to trip on LSD. I think their music was fine without the heavy substances.","It is a great song, did you know none of the 4 Beatles could read music?","That makes sense. They came from humble beginnings. They learned everything by ear. I don't think they missed much by not reading music.","They are so creative!! I would have wanted to watch them live but they stopped touring","I think they couldn't hear themselves play. People just screamed the whole time. They probably got pretty bad at performing too. Better to stick to the studio","Yes it was too much too overwhelming and probably they needed better amplifiers but that is what technology allowed at the time","The times have changed, but the Beatles remain popular. Perennial favorites.","Beatlmania remains. They were excellent in rock and roll but they went beyond experimenting with indian music, hard rock and more!! They Rock","I think that is the essence of great music. Willingness to explore and experiment with other genres and ideas and make them your own.","They are from the 60' but they had the best selling album of the 2000's","I think they will have the best selling albums in the next century, too!

Not only was the movie bad, but its soundtrack was wretched.","Ah I haven't seen that movie, I did like Michael Jackson's taste in clothes, I never knew that he helped write the soundtrack for sonic 3 that is a great game","I did not know that. Did you know Spielberg played the clarinet on the \"Jaw\\'s\" soundtrack?","haha I didn't know that, that is still a great movie, did you know the plain grey shirt that mark Zuckerburg wears is worth several hundred dollars per shirt? like what brand is that","I don't think I could ever spend that much on a shirt, or any article of clothing. Considering his $$$ Hawaiian estate, I am surprised I never see him in an aloha shirt.","haha ya, also wild that the t-shirt was invented in 1904, it seems so obvious but that was when it first appeared","And, back then, a tee shirt was purely an undergarment. Today it is that an more. We even have designer tees that go with a blazer jacket. I guess we could call it clothing evolution.","speaking of evolution, did you know the princess bride's soundtrack was composed by the lead singer of dire straits? like how could he be so good at so many things","Mark Knopfler is my favorite guitarist and a truly gifted musician. While I did not know that, it does not surprise me. One of my favorite soundtracks is the Venture's original Batman. Did you know each track title is the scientific genus or family name of a bat?","No I didn't know that, that is a great movie though, do you like that Batman movie or the Tim burton 1989 batman movie?","It was one of the better remakes with \"Bat Computer\". Speaking of computers, did you know Apple had its own shortlived clothing line in 1986?","No I didn't know that, i wonder if those clothes are worth money? Like is it just big apple logos on everything?"],"emotion":["positive","witty","very knowledgeable","informative"]},{"dialogue":["Hello, are you interested at all in clothing information?","Yeah that's surprising right? I always saw them in books dressed fully in black, it's funny to think that was only for special occasions, like the opposite of how we do now.","Yea, it's pretty crazy that Apple had a clothing line in 1986 too. I wonder how much those original clothing is worth now","I wonder if you can still find them! There's a store in Alabama that sells unclaimed baggage, maybe there's some Apple clothing there.","I wonder if they sell any rip curl clothes that are made in North Korea in that store","Rip Curl is an interesting brand too! They say their clothes are from North Korea but I believe the label says \"Made in China\", it definitely takes away from the novelty.","I thought it was illegal to sell items made in North Korea in the US, I wonder how Rip Curl gets around that","Oh that's definitely true, I guess since it's clearly not truly from there it's ok. The culture around clothing is interesting, like people can tell if your clothes are tailored or not based on if there are collar gaps.","Lol, I must have not met a lot of style aficionados because no one has mentioned my collar gaps to me","Ahah well I think you can look fashionable without going that far. I like polo shirts, they were actually invented by famous tennis player Rene Lacoste.","Interesting. At Billy May's funeral the pallbearers wore his bule shirt and khaki style oufit","That's a sweet gesture, it seems strange but you can see why they did that. Similarly, in Hawaii, business and office attire is an aloha shirt, not a suit and tie like it is in the United States.","I wish I could go into my job in an alhoa shirt like they do in Hawaii","Oh definitely, instead we deal with a lot more strictness. Like did you know button down and button up refer to different styles? Depending on if the collor tips fasten to the shirt.","No, I thought button down and button up referred to the same shirt style lol","Yeah it's definitely too fancy for me regardless. Are you interested in soundtracks as well?","Yea, O brother where art thou? is a great soundtrack and it has been certified 8 times platinum","I haven't heard it but I wonder if it's been translated to other languages too! Like the Tarzan soundtrack was so big Phil Collins recorded it in 5 different languages.","It's kinda funny Phil Collins recorded his songs in 5 different language yet the Tarzan movie didn't do good at the box office","Wow I didn't know it did poor at the box office? I wonder if Batman Begins did bad as well.

Maybe we should start a tiger cafe to spread awareness! Like the ones they have for cats in Japan, you know.","They have a cat cafe near my house so I don't have to take a trip to Japan","Woah, really? That's awesome! Do you get to interact with the cats there?","Yea there's like 10 cats just hanging around and you pay $10 for an hour with them","So cool. Though personally I've always been a dog person - just like Google is.","I like dogs cool, it's pretty cool Istanbul has a vending machine that feeds stray dogs","That's how it should be in all cities! Do you think it took the dogs long to figure out how to recycle there?","I don't know, dogs are pretty smart, they can instinctively understand pointing","They're so smart, they should rule over us. I vote to elect dogs as our overlords. They'd do much better than that cat they've got for mayor in Alaska.","That's pretty cool, it spent most of its time in office sleeping since a cat sleeps for 10 years in the first 15 years of life","They are some sleepy things, aren't they? Though apparently one cat woke up long enough to help write a physics paper!","That's pretty cool. The cat in Godfather 1 was a stray cat found on set","Lucky kitty. Would you ever consider cloning your pets? I know there's a service that does it for dogs, and they've already cloned at least one cat.","No I'm not into the whole idea of pet cloning","Ah, I understand that. It is kinda creepy, just how there are more pets in Japan than there are young kids.","Maybe they can just clone the blood since dogs have 12 different blood types","Hmm, you may be on to something there.

Have you heard of the song 'Small Bump' by Ed Sheeran?","I really enjoy Ed Sheeran's music but have not heard of that song either before. Do you know what Sheeran's original intentions were for that song since he voiced he didn't approve of the anti-abortion usage.","It was about a friend who had a miscarriage which is a nice thing to do. What do you think about people using stuff with permissions (such as songs)?","Oh ok, that's very nice of him. All his songs are really good and catchy, I'll have to YouTube it later. Well, there's two ways of looking at it, if I were famous, then I wouldn't want people using my songs without permission because I could get paid for it. But, if I weren't famous, then I'd want people to use my song, because then if it went viral, I could be famous haha. What do you think?","I agree. However if you are promoting something you need to get permissions like reagan using bruce springsteen's song born in the USA. Do you know other musicians that have spoken out?","I can't recall of any other musicians who have spoken out about that issue. I'd imagine Eminem may be a potential candidate since he writes such personal songs. Eminem also happens to be one of Sheeran's biggest musical influences! What are yours?","I like eminem as well. That influence drove ed to win lots of awards such as Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. Do you know of any other awards he won?","I\\'m sure there must be a grammy to that list of awards Sheeran has won. It\\'s amazing how generous he is by giving away songs to other artists, like Justin Bieber\\'s hit, \"Love Yourself\" was written by Sheeran but since he didn\\'t think it fit in with his album, he passed it off to Bieber!","Ed is very talented when it comes to music. He has a better vocal range than Freddie Mercury. Can you sing?","Wow, that's impressive, I was reminded by Freddie Mercury with the recent film biography about him. I can sing, but not in public haha. Can you? I think my lack of skill for singing has something to do with how humans have evolved, we've come to lose our body hair as recently as 240K years ago!","I will pass on the singing part. Too bad my voice won'f fix itself like a rib can. Humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months of having it surgically shortened. Have you had surgery at all?","Wow, that's insane, ribs can grow back?! I bet that's painful but what's more painful is the screeching sound of nails scratching on the chalkboard, does that sound fall in the frequency that causes fear in humans?","Yikes, I can imagine it does. That might be due to our DNA. Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50000 years ago. I sure this was picked up then...haha","Thats' been a long time! What benefit do you think there is if humans were able to synthesize our own Vitamin C like animals and plants do? The only thing I can think of is probably savings on Orange Juice purchases.","I did not know that. Did you know that humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals? Hard to imagine all animals.","Humans being adapted for distance runners? Wow, I'm really out of shape then and need to start hitting the gym because if I run even for one minute straight, I start panting like crazy. How about yourself?","I'm trying to get back in shape. I assume are earlier ancestors we in decent shape since all they could do was walk around and try to survive. They would have been called hominins. Do you follow the history of humans?","I don't follow much history about humans but I do follow politics and the colors red and blue used to signify Republicans and Democrats have only been in use since the 2000s, I thought it existed forever! When do you think the animals were introduced?","I would imagine back in 1957 when truman refused to be photographed while riding a dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with republicans.","I think you may have a great point but could be earlier than that since there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since the 1850s!"],"emotion":["positive","enlight"]},{"dialogue":["Hello there, I hope you are doing well. Are you a fan of Ed Sheeran?","Not too much, but I do think he is very talented. Do you hear that antiabortion campaigners have used one of his songs to advocate for their own cause?","Yes and it was actually a miscarriage.","Yeah sounds like he wrote it about a friend who had one. Did you know Bruce Springsteen once objected to someone using one of his songs?","Yes I wonder why they cannot sue them to stop using them, but I guess they can be used as longs as there is no financial gain?","Yeah you might be right, I know if I was an artist I wouldn't like it if a politician used it for their campaign.","Its interesting that the Republican Party in the 1800's is more like the Democrats of today.","That is funny, did you know that every president with a beard has been republican?","Or how about Democrat or Republican presidents since 1853. Where is the other parties?","Yeah to not have a president outside of those two parties is not cool. We need to come together and change that, have more than those options and not feel like you are throwing away a vote.","I vote third party in the last presidential elections because I didn't like either candidate. I didnt feel like I was wasting my vote.","I voted the same myself in the last, I think that is just how the majority of people think.","How about Ed Sheeran having a better vocal range than Freddie Mercury or giving a hit song to Justin Bieber.","Yeah that is pretty wild to think about. I guess he also claims Eminem is a huge influence.","I wonder why Eminem would be an influence. I would have never guest that.","I know right, I thought the same thing. Their musical styles are so different.","I guess creative types get their inspiration from many different areas so maybe its not so weird after all.","That is true. Did you know he wrote and recorded the song I See Fire, for the movie the Hobbit, in one day, that is impressive.","I once saw a documentary on him doing his shows.

Rumor has it Sheeran has a better vocal range than Freddie Mercury. That's a bold comparison, don't ya think?","That's definitely a little bold. I'm not sure I've heard anything that good from him. Did you know he gave one of his songs to Justin Bieber?","No, I did not. Justin Bieber I've always considered a singer who appeals to tween girls and single crazy cat ladies, not a legitimate musician... Same with Sheeran. It's amazing what will sell to some demographics.","Yeah, that's true. Did you know you can regrow part of your rib?","No! Now I wonder why anyone would have their rib shortened?! I also wonder why humans may have lost yet magically regrew body hair within the past 240k years","Yeah, that's pretty strange. The human body is very complex and confusing. Did you know there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans?","I did know that. We are born with only two fears - Loud noise and falling. The rest is legitimately learned fears. Kinda like people who are afraid to speak of politics... If a person is scared, there's a reason for such! Which side of the proverbial fence do you consider yourself to stand on?","I think there's many fears one can be born with. I think fears are primitive ways of helping us avoid danger and survive.","Maybe. Haha I can\\'t really pinpoint what my biggest \"fear\" was before maybe the age of 3. Did you know only Republican Presidents wore beards?","I didn't know that. Did you know Harry truman refused to be photographed on Dumbo as it would be associated with republicans?","I did not know that. I do recall the symbols of the two parties being either a donkey or an elephant, not merely red or blue. I think those symbols are rather outdated and are due for a change.","That's true. There hasn't been a president since 1853 that was not republican or democrat.","I've never understood why some people identify solely as one or the other. I cannot really claim allegiance to one or the other as there's not one person alive who I agree with every.single.thing. on.","Yeah, I do believe life is not just black and white and you can't just stick to one side the entire time just for the sake of loyalty.","Humans allegedly began exhibiting behavioral modernity 50k years ago. Could it be we as a species are regressing?! Losing that little knack as we did our hair?!","That's interesting. Did you know most plants and animals can synthesize their own vitamin c, but we can not because of a defective gene.","I knew that. I'm a huge lover of the ocean and all things nautical: Scurvy didn't just climb onboard vessels lol. Did you ever watch the show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver?","No, I didn't. What was it about?","Evidently he was a comedian. He mentioned a Tweet by The Dropkick Murphy's in 2016.

It's also crazy knowing there has never been a non-republican president with a beard.","In 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republicans. And people talk about Trump being childish, it's always went on. Lol","Agreed. Crazy to think that happened in the 1950s especially when figures seemed more mature. It's the nature of the beast I suppose. Politicians have to do whatever satisfies their base. Like I couldnt believe Regan campaigned for democrats and was once against high corporate profits!","Yes, it's gotten so divided in the country, it's sad. Reagan was good in that respect. He could honestly campaign for someone from a different party.","I know. It's sad to think people wouldn't dare do that these days.

I am also surprised that it is illegal to own a rabbit in queensland without having a magicians license or being a scientist. What do they have against pet rabbits?","Haha hilarious. There are too many wild rabbits there. Only one scientist has ever walked on the moon...Harrison Schmitt.","That is neat. I am amazed at scientists. Did you know that Harvard scientists managed to store a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria. How did they really know it was there? Sounds sketchy\/","Sounds very sketchy! The emperor of Japan was a scientist and he still published papers!","Hmmm. Did you know that the first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada Lovelace?","Sounds like a Harry potter character lol! I am thankful to the english scientist who invented the world wide web in 1989!","So is Al Gore! LOL.","haha hilarious. That english scientist who discovered the web did it with a state-funded organization. They should be proud.","Absolutely! The first google computer at Stanford was housed in lego bricks. Not sure what that says!","Haha I would love to see that in action. Also never smoke near apple computers as it voids the warranty!","I had no idea. Thank goodness I don't smoke. I am sure that I would be the one to void it if possible.","Haha maybe so. The russians even made a ocmputer that ran on water once. Well on that note I will say goodbye. It was lovely talking with you."],"emotion":["curious","amused","positive"]},{"dialogue":["Hello, what's of interest to you?","Me too although the internet has kept me out of them for years.","Yeah that's true most of the information can be accessed online now. But one library in Sacramento has things like sewing machines you can borrow","Wow, that's cool. I've only been to Sac once. It would cool if they did that with power tools.","Hopefully more libraries will do that. Whoa yeah power tools would be sweet and a great idea. They can be very expensive to buy.","Yes, I don't use them enough to justify the expense.","Yeah and I didn't realize how many libraries there were in the US (more libraries than McDonalds) and over half the population have library cards.","Libraries are cool. I used to frequent them. It is one of the best things one can do for free.","Yeah I don't use them enough either. Now computers can basically do everything and it's basically like having a library at home.","The internet and computers have taken on the role, perhaps too much. There is something satisfying about turning pages.","Yeah I agree. In addition, the technology continues to improve every day. Transhumanists for example want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!","Yeah, I heard that. As long as they stick to smart people like the English scientist that invented the www.","Yeah good point, I can't imagine how smart that guy must be!","Smarter than me! We also don't really need weapon makers like the people that built the bomb that erased Hiroshima.","Yes that's true. Atleast some good has come of it with the Brazilian physicist Mascarenhas making all those advances with measuring radiation levels.","I worked in the nuclear industry and radiation is scary. A dirty explosive would be enough to paralyze a city.","Wow I can't imagine that! Have you ever been tested for radiation?","We wore a TLD badge that was tested regularly (Time Lapsed Doesmeter). Kind of like they did to test people in 1945.","Oh that's good. Yeah the current technology-electron spin resonance sounds pretty cool.","Yes. Technology booms. Nice talking to you.","You too thanks","Over and out..."],"emotion":["positive","scientific"]}]
