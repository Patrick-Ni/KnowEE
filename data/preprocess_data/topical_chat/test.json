There's also a radio station that translates solar activity into sound so that you can listen live to the sun's music. I wonder what it sounds like?","It is probably better than regular AM radio!","Haha! I thought you were going to say it's probably better than Hanson! But a Hanson song once became the most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because the DJs didn't reveal the band. Sneaky!","Probably better than that also!","I'd rather listen to Hanson than a ventriloquist. One of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist.

I'm sure football pays more than bowling, these days! Ha. So, the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916! When Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!","Yeah, now that is crazy to hear.

After watching Patrick Mahomes this past season I've added the Chiefs to my list of favorites!","That's cool, I never think about them. I'm pretty mainstream and rookie.

I could not have done that!","i never thought about it like that but you're right. The announcers probably mentioned it every time he had the ball.","All eyes on him.

I guess if it was expected of him then he probably did.","Well, he was so good at it, he got it banned from college basketball for over a decade. I'm sure every game everyone was watching to see if he'd dunk the ball. Do you like basketball, too?","I like some. I did watch the women's big 12 championship game last night. It was actually pretty good for a while. I'm glad the dunk shot is no longer banned by the way.","That's awesome, I watch it occasionally, as well. I find it ironic that James Naismith was the only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history, though. He invented the game of basketball after all.","That is odd! You would think that he would know the game inside out and be the best at it after all.","Exactly, or would have at least rewritten the rules to favor his team, somehow.

I guess if I got the chance to do it again, I would be a pro bowler in the 60's!","I guess thats a safer sport, football has proven to cause a lot of brain damage in players so thats not good.","Yeah it has, if you ever watch the movie Concussion, with Will Smith, it definitely makes you think twice about how much damage the sport does to ones body and brain most of all.","I think ive seen that film before, I will google it later or maybe its available in Netflix, there is a crazy rules the New Orlans Saints have, its really sexist and rude in fact.","Yeah that rule seems so outdated and dumb.

An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay! So few minutes for such pain!","Right, and that's part of the reason football doesn't interest me, not a lot of live gameplay.

I don't think I've seen the commercial you mention - was it on during the SB?","Good idea about the end zone. The commercial was in the Super Bowl and cracked me up because when the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit - it was back to work - and he really wanted the car! So funny!","I guess I tuned out the commercials like I tuned out most of the SB game... and our game of squares was terrible!","Sounds like you are a big fan - funny fact, an average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro football player - I think engineering is safer.","That doesn't surprise me at all, given the average career in the NFL is less than 3 years and while the superstars make a ton, the average guy doesn't","I think that the political controversies of the past few years hasn't helped the sport too much - some people just want to watch folks play ball.

I wonder how much money top pro bowlers make? Most of the professional athletes didn't make much money until the TV revenue started rolling in and popularity of the superstars","I'm sure TV had a lot to do with it. Another fun fact - the highest scoring game was in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0. Ouch. Poor coach!","Talk about a blow out!

Plus land, more area in the US in golf courses than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.","That's a lot of land! There is a golf course in Dubai that needs 4 million gallons of water per day.","My point on wasted water, especially if climate change drives more heat in the atmosphere. Crazy. Odd how sports have changed, you see where the Top Bowler (I assume Dick Weber being that old) made twice as much as the top football stars? Times have changed.","Yes they sure have. Did you hear about what the University of Iowa did to their visitors locker room?","I hate to admit it, but I got a Writing degree at the University of Iowa, I didn't know about that then. I wonder if that was to pysche them out, or distract them during game preparation? I'm not aware of many Big 10 championships there so it must not have been totally successful. I see that there's no rule against women playing in the NFL, do you think there will ever be a female place kicker? I've seen some amazing female soccer players.","I think we will see one at some point. What do you think of the superimposed yellow first down line that ESPN created and won an emmy for? It sure changed the way we watch the game on tv.","I thought Emmy's were awards for people, I hope it was to the guy at ESPN who invented it and yes does give you visualization at first down yardages. Did you see where the average engineer makes more in his lifetime that the average NFL and MLB player? There must be a lot of injury shortened and short careers to bring the big money players contracts.","My guess would be because the engineer has a longer career.

I guess that good when you think about injuries and the wear and tear on the players bodies and more commercial time to boot!","Seems like a short amount of time and yet they stretch it out to 3 hours. lol What do you think of the tracking chips that the NFL is putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?","I don't understand why they'd need them on the players, on the ball it seems like they'd be able to track out of bounds, pass the goal line and first downs with that chip. They could either check on the referee's performance or eventually make that the deciding ball placement. I see a lot of use in the tracking chip in the ball.","I agree. Here's an interesting stat: Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career. Impressive!","Yes, I moved to the Boston area 4 years ago so I'm in the heart of Patriot Football and they talk about a lot of football facts year round, but I'd never heard that and that is impressive (assuming he had a normal amount of carries).I knew about Canadian Football, rugby and Austrian rules, had you ever heard about Gaelic Football?

The second-best job for athletes is commentator, though, like those of a lot of football players.","I have noticed that a lot of players go on to be commentators.

I also doubt that any of their players go on to the NFL, but the average lifetime earnings of an engineer (which a lot of students at the academies study) are higher than that of an average NFL player anyway.","I would certainly take the engineer career path in that case.

How is it even possible to score that many points in one game?!","I'm sure it wasn't a fair fight, given how new the game was back then.

Can you imagine if there were chips in golf balls to measure all of those movement metrics?","That would be amazing. I do wonder why they do not use these chips when making calls instead of relying just on reviews.","It's still a game rooted in tradition, I guess, plus someone could probably hack and manipulate the data--that's a can of worms you don't want to open! Plus the reviews take up so much of the time; that's part of the experience, and how people spend over 3 hours watching a game in which there are only an average of 11 minutes of live play.","I suppose so. You mentioned gold earlier. Do you enjoy golf?","I've never even played on a proper course haha. I have terrible hand-eye coordination, nor the patience to be any good. It also seems like a kind of waste of land--golf course in America take up more space than Rhode Island and Delaware combined!","That is a waste of land.

I wonder if he can even still play ;)","NO. He has been a Coach at Alabama for years. There is apparently a big difference between coaching at the college level and coaching in the NFL.

So that sounds like a dream come true for him, right ?","Lots of people would jump at the chance and you would think that the pay is a lot more in the Pros?","Am.. I would ;) Is it not ?","Are you a Pats fan? It seems that year after year Tom Brady is the guy to beat.

I am sure he is due to retire soon.","finally, I'm tired of hearing his name everywhere ;) His wife is a model, right?","Yes. They are definitely a power couple. Do you watch Game of Thrones?

I think it is time to have that rule removed to be honest.","I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.","Yeah I agree with you on that. Do you know what the average actual time of gameplay is for an average NFL game?","Something like 10 minutes, right?

I can see that as well, but that is really funny.","I want to know who thought it would be a great intimidation move, to paint the U of IA visitor's locker room pink. To me, that is only providing much needed ambiance to your opponent.","That is so funny, I guess it calms people down seeing that color so it makes sense to put it in the opposing teams locker room.","Maybe they thought it would annoy them, lol. It's interesting, when you realize that top bowlers used to make more than football players.","That is interesting, it goes to show just how big the NFL has gotten since then.","I think engineers make more, as well.","Over the average career they do, I think it takes in account how long their careers are compared to pro sports players.","You do have a point.

These days, there are too many ads and too much commentary with not enough action.","But NFL has become so popular over the years. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.","Yes! I wonder why. Were both sports televised? Was pay based on live attendance too?

Well, it's still televised.

Sadly, others suffer injuries that limit the options they have later on.","It's amazing how much technology is used in the NFL these days","Yes, I was reading about the chips that they're using in shoulder pads.

The Patriots haven't been one of the greatest teams in the NFL because Belichick held on to players for too long, at least.","Yep. The guy makes a lot of tough moves, and isn't sentimental about his roster. Even after losing last year, I still think they have a shot again this year.","Absolutely!

Some of the people I work with have been huge football fans since high school and before. One came from a Texas HS team that had a stadium bigger than any we had here.","That cool. I was looking about Alex Smith and saw where he got his bachelor's degree in 2 years and then began working on his masters.","Alex Smith is one of the hard workers in the league. In addition to education, his own team members comment on just how dedicated he is to the job.","Do you like Drama tv shows or movies?","Ive never been much in to dramas. Much more of a Sci-Fi\/Fantasy type.","Oh well, the actor Hugh Laurie from House is the highest paid tv drama, making 700,000 an episode.","I did enjoy that show at the beginning. But, with most dramas, it went a bit overboard in the stories and just ended up too melodramatic.","I believe that too. Jim Carrey actually doesn't play in dramas anymore because he feels like they don't bring any type of positivity.","I had heard that about him, and I like that. It's much more his style. Some people can do multiple genres, he's not really one. Patrick Stewart can, though. He not only does comedy voice overs, he also teaches drama classes in the UK.","I never really got into Star Trek, but he is a wonderful actor in X-Men. American Dad is good too, but I don't watch it much.","It's a fun show. Short on drama, decent for comedy. And lots of cameos by other actors.","I love the alien Roger, he's hilarious.","If you get a chance, take a look at The Orville.

Quite a contrast to the drubbing that Cumberland took in 1916.","These teams needed something to help them perform better offensively--maybe a fight song--somthing similar to the one written by Snoop Dog for his son's school.","Snoop! He really has the talent. He should run for office, maybe president.","I wonder what his net worth is these days. Did yo know the highest paid employees of the US Department of Defense are football coaches? But I bet they can't rap!","Sports brings in the money, so coaches command high salaries. In an age when we need scientists and engineers, the money goes to spectacle.","Yup. But our children are trained that way. Have you ever been to a high school football game in Texas? Down in Allen Texas they have a high school stadium worth ^60 million and which seat 18,000 fans. Yeah, we train our children toward spectacle.","The parents and community members in those Texas towns probably don't have much else for entertainment. Still, once high school is done, those students will not be players. They need education.","That is unless the high schoolers go on to college, where the spectacle continues! 14 or the world's 25 largest stadiums are at American colleges.","Schools want money, and alumni want winning teams.

I've heard that the White House still usues floppy disks. I wonder if that's for security.","Maybe.

Roosevelt banned Christmas Trees from the White House.","Yes, he was really into environmental issues and didn't approved of cutting down trees.

I dint' even know those could still be read.","I wonder if they have any pictures of aliens on them, lol. Did you know bullets hit the white house?","I didn't know about that! That is scary. It's interesting how the term 'white house' has come to be used not only for the building but also for the president and all his advisers.","It took the secret service 4 days to realize the bullets though","That's so strange and they never found who did it?

I did not know the UK did their own version of thats 70s show that was canceled after 10 episodes though.","yeah, that show was ok, kinda funny from what I remember. Hard to believe only 1 episode of the simpsons without bart, mentioned or appearing.","Yeah I still watch it on Netflix every now and then if I am bored, I have been re watching game of thrones as of late though.","ahh yeah, I did binge through the game of thrones series. Do you know when the series will be released?","Yep, I love it, the next season starts April 14th.I really wish it wasn't the last season but GRRM just takes too long to finish the books.","perfect! Looking forward to it returning.","Yeah it will be interesting to see how john and Daenerys deal with who gets the throne, since john is the actual heir.","yeah, should be good. will be interesting to see.","Yep, will it was nice talking to you, have a good day.","you too!","Good conversation always makes these hits better."],"emotion":["neutral","content","positive","agreeable"]},{"dialogue":["Do you enjoy the NFL?","I'm not surprised. There are an extreme amount of commercials, reviews, and penalties. I did not know that there are no written rules against female players in the NFL. But they have to meet the eligibility requirements and as large as those men are I doubt that happens.","I did not know that there were no rules against women, but like you said it would be unlikely that any woman could meet the requirements. The players have tracking chips in their shoulder pads and the ball as well. I guess that has helped with various informations.","I have to wonder why they would need to track them so closely. There are cameras everywhere and they use the cameras and the refs to make calls so why the need to track them so precisely?","I would have no idea. I wonder why air jordans were banned when they were first introduced.","I do not know. My guess is that they considered it product placement and didn't want to allow him the advertisement during games. Jordan wore them anyway though and Nike paid his fines.","Your are probably correct. Wow, I guess the fine was nothing for them to cover. Do you know who Allen Iverson is or that he had a contract with Reebock that would pay him $800,000 a year until he was 55?","I don't but that's a huge contract. He's set for life. I did know that Reggie Miller has a sister who was better than him at basketball in high school. She scored more points them him and broke eight national records.","Their ability must be at least partially genetic. I did not know the NBA includes 1 team that is from Canada, that is interesting.","I didn't either. I also did not know that basketball players are the highest paid athletes based on average annual salary per player. I would have thought that football players made more.","I would have thought the same as you. I wonder what the Granny Style technique is. Physicists say it is the best technique for scoring points but that no one does it because it looks stupid.","That's when you squat and throw the ball from between your legs underhanded with both hands. I would think it would be harder to aim that way not easier.","Oh, thank you. I can not imagine how that would be a good way to score points. I did not know that Paul Allen owned teams. I wonder what became of them after he died?","No problem. That question I do not know the answer to. A player named Tim Duncan delayed his entrance in the NBA to complete college. I'm glad he saw that education was important but that was risky because they may not want you four years later when you finish.","Yes it was risky but it is nice to learn that some of the players actually do prioritize their education. I guess it is rare. Did you know tha the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can not eat in the same restaurant as the players and even if they are there first they have to leave if a player somes in?","That's horrible. I don't think they treat their cheerleaders well and I don't like that aspect. I recently discovered that most make around minimum wage.","That is terrible and we know that they can all easily afford to pay them a lot more. So the regular season ends in late Dec. So I guess the big game is coming up soon. Will you watch?","I'm sure I will but I'm not excited about it. I'm so sick of seeing the Patriots. It's boring to see them at this point. I'd rather see other teams. Six teams from each conference make the playoffs and we end up with the Patriots again\/","Oh yes I heard that. I also heard about some call in a game that a ref made. Some people were quite upset about it. I agree a different team makes it more fun.","There were terrible calls in both games but I would imagine you are talking about them not calling pass interference during the Saints game. It was a very bad call or lack of I suppose."],"emotion":["negative","positive","surprised"]},{"dialogue":["I knew of Paul Allen and his relationship with Bill Gates in the founding of Microsoft. But I did not know he was an owner with the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazer franchises. Did you?","He did not and the nearest heir is his sister. From what I have been reading, she is not into sports like Paul was. So she might want to sell rather than try to run the franchises.","That's probably her best shot anyway. Better to sell it to someone who loves sports. So are you a fan of the NBA? I am and hope to one day visit the the head offices in New York! I bet it is a fascinating to see!","I followed the Bulls when I lived in Chicago for about 10 years and Michael Jordon was king. Since moving back to Louisiana, I have not really followed it that much. Speaking of MJ, did you know that the NBA banned him from wearing Nike Air Jordan shoes. . He did anyway and Nike covered the fines. That was a good PR move for Nike.","Agreed. A very wise decision in my opinion! They make so much money off sponsorships, its insane! Like Allen Iverson, he signed a lifetime deal with Reebok that pays him $800k per year until he hits 55. Then they'll pay him a lump sum of $32 million. That is just downright unbelievable!","Endorsements and sponsorship deals are extremely lucrative. It seems the stars make more money that way than playing the game. Switching to the NFL, do you know of any Tom Brady endorsements? He has to have some major ones in the works with another Superbowl win.","No kidding! I can only imagine! Ha! But can you believe that NFL and MLB players make less in a lifetime than engineers do?","We always hear about the star's salaries, but not the rest of the 1st and 2nd string. So I could see that an engineer with a 40 year career could easily out earn an average NFL player with a 10 year career. A guess that given the few slots available to move up from collegiate to pro, you enter the draft when the time is right regardless if you are nearing finishing your degree.","That is true. But you know what gets me? There are no rules that against females playing as long as they meet the requirements. So I can't believe one has never been signed as at least a kicker, especially in this day and age!","The glass ceiling for refs came crashing down during the playoffs with the 1st NFL ref officiating a playoff game. So, it is probably just a matter of time. What I find interesting is how tech has changed the game. Now we have tracking chips in shoulder pads and balls to know precise location and other parameters.","Agreed. It's amazing how technologically advanced the game has become, despite the actual live gameplay itself only lasting an average of 11 minutes!","I am still trying to figure that one out. We have four f15 minute quarters, or 60 minutes. So where does the time go? I wonder with the advent of TV, game play time is affected by the need for commercial breaks?","I would imagine so. It just doesn't seem real though, does it? Speaking of unreal NFL facts, can you believe Saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the Saints players? In fact, if a player enters a restaurant they're dining in, the cheerleaders have to leave. I'm surprised no discrimination lawsuits have been filed over that!","Some traditions \/ superstitions revolving around sports is unreal! For example, its a proven fact that \"granny style\" is the most consistent shooting style for free throws. NBA players refuse to do it because \"it looks stupid\".","Ha! I don't blame them there, even though I wouldn't be surprised to see a player eventually try that approach. But when you're the best paid athletes by average annual salary in the world, looking silly is the last thing one would want!","I guess... Do you watch much sports on TV or mainly other shows?","I do and I actually love the Simpson's. There's one episode in particular where Bart never makes an appearance nor is even mentioned that I still want to see. What about you?","I do not watch much sports on TV. Its just not the same as being there. So, I have season tickets to my alma mater, the LSU Tigers. The Simpson's have been going strong since 1989 - thats unbelievable. Did you know that when Family Guy ended, the crew received flowers from the Simpsons production team? I wonder if it was congratulations, condolences, or a bit of both?","Ha! I think it was more of a thank you. I can only guess neither of them like Family Guy. Were you a fan of the 70s Show? I was looking forward to seeing the UK remake but it was sadly cancelled after 10 episodes.","The 70s Show was not really my style. I am more into drama. And, the kids when younger were into Thomas the Tank Engine and similar shows. Did you know Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin all did more than 52 episodes of Thomas? I found that astonishing considering Carlin and Baldwin are both know for very salty language!","Oh, no! I wasn't aware of that. Hard to believe all three of them served as narrators! I was into Pokemon more when I was younger although I don't think I watched even half of the 750 episodes of Pokemon. Ha! That is far too manu. Well it was a pleasure chatting with you!

I mean, if they can create chips that tracks players movements and ball location\/speed\/velocity\/rotation, they can extent the live gameplay time. It's ridiculous, Isn't it?","That is ridiculous, I'm not sure why they would want to know the rotation of the ball, but I can understand why they want to know a player's speed and location","You're right.

I will have to check that out and see what he has to say.","I would imagine alot of it is about his TB12 method of staying in shape and being at the top of his game","He seems to be more of a deep thinker these days, he says he wants to know the \"why\\'s\" in life. I think we would all like to know those answers.","Maybe he wants to know why he went from a 6th round draft pick nobody to a surefire hall of famer. He had the odds stacked against him quite a bit","Having watched him play at Michigan, he came along way. I think there is something to be said about Coach Belichick. Having won 6 Super Bowls is no easy accomplishment.","True, he has done some amazing things and gotten the most out of his players over the last 20 years. Even though he still dresses like a homeless person","Living in Big Ten country I was very familiar with the Iowa Hawkeyes pink visiting locker room, but what they don't tell you is some schools will have an assistant get to the locker room early and cover all the walls in posters to cover the pink up.","I am guessing the pink is meant to mess with the visiting team? That seems like a strange tradition","I had no idea the NFL had no rules against female players. Could you imagine? A 270 lb defensive end would kill the poor thing.","Well, they would still have to be eligible and also in strong enough physical condition to compete and be signed by a team.","I've noticed they have mixed sports and religion in our reading section. They say the bible is the best selling book of all time. Religion and football are two of the biggest deals in the South.","From personal experience, I can confirm that football is religion in the south.","You having southern experience, did you know the New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at a restaurant that a player is in? That's crazy, almost as crazy as the Rams robbing the Saints from being in the Super Bowl.","Yes, and if the cheerleaders are eating and the players come in the restaurant, the cheerleaders have to leave.","They are saying that an engineer has higher earnings over a lifetime of an NFL player, but I find that really hard to believe . The league minimum in 2019 is 495k.","But players on average only play a couple of years in the NFL, an engineer will earn 6 figures for 20 or so years.","I agree with what you are saying, but it's not like that player is never going to work again when he retires at 28 years of age. And some of those guys will play into their 40's like Tom Brady. Anyway I would like to thank you for chatting with me, and it looks like we have achieved our goal here.","Yes, but the average career in the NFL is less than 3 years, so that is roughly 1.5 million during their lifetime NFL earnings, much less than an engineer.","Keep in mind, that's the league minimum.","Yes, but the majority of players in the NFL, backups and what have you play for around the league minimum.

What I find intriguing is that they are making videos about Tom Brady\\'s \"spiritual journey\" on Facebook watch with his friend Gotham Chopra, the son of New Age guru Deepak Chopra. I am not sure where the traditional bible fits in Tom Brady\\'s quest?","People always seem to use the word Bible out of context. The word comes from biblia-books, but still, I think that they are trying to put religion into something that is a sport.","Being from an older generation, the bible was not excluded from elementary school reading assignments. But, I am glad its no longer required reading. I struggle with the Bible being wholly \"the word of god\". It was written by humans after all. And which bible, the Jewish Bible, the Christian Bible, the Mormon Bible, or upcoming Woman\\'s Bible.

Don\\'t you think that is a bit of a messianic complex?","I think he takes himself too seriously. He is playing a game throwing a pigskin ball around and although the concept of religion might include being a very serious athlete, it is not anything to do with formalized religion, such as Protestantism, etc.","Perhaps, or its a sales pitch to get folks to buy his books and sponsored athletic gear.

With all movements in the society, I'm wondering why there isn't fight for female players...","To be honest, if they want to do it for the money, they'd be better off entering the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players!

Honestly, I'm not sure this is respectful strategy to have painted pink room. I honestly don't think this smart.","It sounds like a bad idea. Ha! But not as bad as forbidding cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players like the Saints do. That is plain wrong and misogynistic, in my opinion!","I also surprised why this rule is still here, because it could be not legal from a lot of points of view. But I'm sure nobody follows it.

Yeah, but I often hear about how football stars or athletes mismanage their money. You think if the females were to play they'd make comparable salaries?","I doubt it. I understand there is no rule they can't play. I suppose they could be a kicker.

We were taught about all religions and the facts of them. We were never told to believe in one or the other.","That's great!

Do you watch ESPN?","They are the ones that came up with the pink line to raise awareness about breast cancer, right?","yellow line on TV, but pink during October I believe, good chatting with you!"],"emotion":["passionate","positive"]},{"dialogue":["Hey there! Do you like football?","Not so much, but I know some interesting facts about football and the NFL! For example, I just learned a little while ago that U of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink!","That's surprising to me! I wonder if it has to do with school colors? Or, do you think it was previously the women's locker room?","I think it probably was meant to be a joke, since pink is typically thought to be a \"feminine\" color. However, I kind of like the idea of football and pink! Breaking down gender norms!","Agreed! I was fascinated to learn that the NFL actually allows female players, if they meet the league's eligibility. Wonder if any have tried out?","I have no idea. I'm guessing not- probably just because of stigma, unfortunately. But props to the NFL! I definitely think we need to see more ladies playing football!","Yes! I heard that many people were actually rooting against Brady's team, because they're kind of over them winning all the time. He sure works hard though, it seems.","I think so, too. But there are other good players as well. I guess RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.","Pretty impressive. I know they get paid a lot for those skills, but did you realize that top bowlers in the 60's made twice as much as football stars then?","I had no idea! That's quite interesting. I wonder why...any ideas?","The only thing I can come up with is that bowling was more popular because it had been around longer?","Probably. I think a lot of things were more popular back then. Diners, roller skating, church, the bible...things like that.","Good point. Funny that you mentioned the bible, as I recently learned that Jefferson used a razor to cut out supernatural parts of the bible.","So weird! I mean, I guess things were just different back then. I guess before 1963, every student was required to read the bible when they were an elementary student.","Wow, that just would cause such an uproar today. Funny how what society approves of changes in such a relatively short timeframe.","I guess not everyone was super religious, though. Apparently Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams didn't use the bible at their swearing-in ceremonies.","Very interesting. Did you also know that the tower of babel is probably based on a real building in Iraq?","Hmm, did not know that! But it makes sense. Even though times are changing, I guess the bible is still the best-selling book of all time.","Yeah, but I bet Tom Brady hopes his book will surpass that!","And I hope for his sake, that it might!

I guess they is a lot of setting up and moving the chains and stuff.","Yeah exactly it. Do you know what the highest score in college football game is?","I imagine it could get quite high. Probably from long ago.","Yeah it was 222-0 when Georiga Tech beat Cumberland","That seems unfair. A lot about football seems unfair. For example, New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are already dining at a restaurant and an NFL player comes in after, the cheerleaders are required to leave.","That is so wrong and sexist, I cannot believe they still have that rule.

They should have won at least once.","Yeah they have and they won it for the superimposed yellow line","For a line on the screen? That seems a bit too simple to deserve an award.","Yeah I know but they got it after all. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?","Never heard of him. Is he famous? What does he do?","yeah he is a former QB who never fumbled the ball in his career","Wow. Impressive. Never? I guess every defense must have been coming after him. I hope he got a raise or a bonus or something.","I hope so too honestly.

Did you know in the NFL they only play for around 11 minutes per game?","Ya. That sure is a lot of action in so little time","There are no rules against women in the NFL, I wonder if we will see that anytime soon?","Perhaps the reason why we don't see them now is because the requirements inherently disqualify most?","You're probably right. Some of the league still has sexist rules about cheerleaders, though, not allowing them to eat in the same restaurant as the players!","I wonder why. I seems unfairly biased","Yeah, it's a strange rule. Did you watch the playoffs and Super Bowl this year?","The opening was a bit disappointing compared to years prior","Yeah. The playoffs were nerve wrecking to me due to fumbles and such. Did you know there is a player who never fumbled the ball his whole career?","Then you must like green ellis","Yeah. Talk about pressure not to mess up your record, though! Speaking of records, I can't believe the Patriots have won 6 out of 8 Super Bowls!

I think they swore on the Constitution.","Interesting. Yet the recent ones have all sworn on the Bible","Yes, I think the tradition is important in today's political climate. In colonial times it was different. Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible, cutting out the 'supernatural' parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. He wanted to see religion in humanist terms.","Which probably did more damage in the end to himself. It would be awesome to see the Etemenanki building in person, since many think it's the referenced Tower of Babel","That would make sense. I could see places in the Bible having connection to places in the Middle East.","It does make sense. It's strange how the root for apple and evil come from the same word in Latin. That's probably why people assume that Eve ate an apple","True. Easy to get confused. On a different topic, do you follow the NFL?","I don\\'t follow it too closely, but I heard Tom Brady released a book that has been dubbed the \"athlete\\'s bible\"","That's interesting. A bible for athletes. I don't know much about the book or Brady.","I just know of him due to the Patriots and their constant winning. Do you follow any of the 32 teams in the NFL?","I usually follow around the playoffs, if at all. I don't have much time to watch. Do you have a chance?","We're in the same boat with the playoffs aspect. I can't keep up on 16 games in the regular season, but I can do a few games and the Super Bowl","The playoffs seem to have more energy. I figure it's the time to pay attention. An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. I wonder what the total for the season is.","Considering that 32 teams play for 16 weeks not counting the single elimination playoff games including the wildcards...that's math I don't want to do","NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a player's moves on the field. They are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location. I wonder how much data that generates per season.","If they're smart enough to create the chips, there must be systems in place to keep track of it all. Hopefully the engineers who came up with that are the ones making more than NFL players in their comparable lifetimes","I hope so too. We need engineers more than we need athletes if we're going to have a good society.","True! Although it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing.

A way to make more money.","I think he is trying to start something before he retires that he can continue...not like he needs the money.","I guess maybe thats the case. I just dont see an athletes bible being something substantial. Just a jocks view.","i agree. I mean the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. Not as much as everyone thought.","Yeah there is a lot of waiting around the tv for the next play. Those 11 minutes are pretty exciting though.","I agree!! Did you know that the nfl uses tracking chips to record speed, rotation of the ball and so many other things.","Yeah they even put them in the players shoulder pads. technology is everywhere I guess.","Kind of scary! Just like being a new orleans saints cheerleader. If they are in a restaurant and a nfl player comes in they have to leave. That is not right!","No its not. I dont see why that rule should be in place . I can see a rule about them not dating or something like that but not allowed to be in the same place at the same time. I dont get it.","I don't either and I think it is over the top. Even the nfl has no written rule against female players as long as they met the eligibility requirements.","I have heard that.

Only the top .001 percent of men are gifted enough to play in the nfl so when a woman comes along who wants to play too, she's going to be really fit and ready","It would be hard!! Look a woman would probably be better off being an engineer.

I know their are a lot of players that dont make it that bring that average down. I just figured the top earners making 20 plus million a year would put the nfl players over the top in that category.","You would think! I heard even 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars!","I believe that. Bowling was a big sport back in the day. Football players didnt have the players union back then so they didnt make nearly what they deserved. I would say now it is a little over the top though.","I agree.

I would like to hear more.","I have not read it yet, but I am very much interested i getting a copy. I am not one of those New England Patriot fans that deify Brady and his coach, Belichick, or consider the Patriots my religion, but I do admire anyone that has performed at the top of their sport for so many years. 6 NFL Championships is incredible.","That is incredible. He is practically a deity. I guess he has earned his status in the heavens. The book is a holy tract.","I understand what idolatry is, and I do not approach that level of religious zeal. I merely thing the phrase, \"In Bill we trust\" which is a mantra or creed spoken often in Boston is an earned sentiment.","That is good. It is important to remain humble and true. There is only one Bill and Tom, but there is a higher authority.","My wife... LOL Thomas Jefferson may have created his own version of the Bible; but my wife would consider herself editor.","The bible did not need editing. I don't know what he was thinking. He must have spent too much time with the women he owned.","Nice. I agree on the lack of need for editing the bible. I was also jesting regarding my wife. I find it sad that Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams chose to not use the bible at their inaugurations.","I think that Ted and John had another agenda, one not parallel to the one set in the Bible.","What is your thinking on the Apocrypha? Do you find any value to these works as complementary to the canonical bible?","The word is broad and varied and it is good to look in places that others have shunned. We do not know the complete Truth because it is hidden.","We see through a glass dimly... But I find it interesting every time archeologists find another site consistent with biblical texts. In fact, they think the tower of babel was based on a real building located in what is modern day Iraq. Interesting.","I think that is an interesting connection that help people recognize the value of the texts.","Yes, and likewise, the documented historic performance of Tom Brady in his long, record-setting career in the NFL helps people to recognize the value of his writings.","I think that his fame and notoriety can only help spread what must be a valuable insight in the human condition.","And it helps to sell books. Although Brady does not seemed strapped for cash...

One quote said that Brady was kind of a Messiah figure. If it's not blasphemy, it's too close to it!","I know! People idolize him.

Hey did you know that top bowlers in the 60's made more than top nfl players?","That is crazy. I wonder how much that was at that time.

I thought it would take a little more than that to win an Emmy, but Im not the judge.","I know but i have to say that line made life a little easier.

Wow, even when there's only eleven minutes of live gameplay, there's so much chatter nonstop around the game! I also devote an entire Sunday to watching the games! Do you watch the games","No, not on TV but I heard that some Patriots try to keep their focus on faith in God rather than on the team on Sundays.","That's good! I wonder if those people wished that reading the bible was part of the education curriculum like prior to 1960s","That could be. The Patriots do have a number of spiritual players like Matthew Slater who's known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based event on Super Bowl Sunday.","Oh I didn't know that. I wonder if there will be as many people tuned in compared to how many copies there has been sold of the bible, a whopping 5 billion copies!","Probably not that many since the 5 billion copy estimate has to do with from the beginning of it's printing, ha, ha. Besides that, another Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va. say that there are faith lessons in Brady's examples he uses in his book.","Oh ok, yeah five billion copies is a LOT! Do you know what type of faith lessons there are?","Well, according to McDaniel, Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds. Brady's career began as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best at his craft.","His story is really worth a read, I wonder if they depict that in the documentary \"Tom vs. Time\", have you seen it?","No,I haven't seen it yet but that will probably be the main focus I would think. Brady coming up from the bottom to the top. Actually, he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity quite nicely.","Yeah my friend has seen it and he told me it changed his perspective on the guy. He's actually a very hard-working nice guy and really puts in a lot of hard work to the game, the team, and his fans. I wonder if they will get an Emmy like what ESPN won for the yellow line used in football games.","That might happen or even better things. Remember last year when the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl and then they came back to win the game in overtime. That was spectacular.","Oh my, that was such a great game! I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time, I wonder if that's why I was so disappointed in this year's game. I think people who placed bets on the game would've preferred the boring game though.","Yes, that's probably true, save the blood pressure and all that. But really, Brady is a great example of what you can do if you're really committed. It seems that Brady is totally committed to his TB12 Method and he is really sincere.","Yeah, that's the message I'm getting as well. Do you know what the 12 stands for in the TB12?","It would think it means 12 methods like the title shows because he's talking about a number of areas.

Did you know they put tracking chips in the footballs to track the data such as velocity, etc. on them?","I did not know that. That's probably why players get fined so much for throwing them into that stands. I heard that they also have tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads to record they're every move.","Crazy how the game has come along technology wise. I wish the actual gameplay was longer though. There's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an average NFL game.","I know, that seems so short. It's 2 hours and 49 minutes of crap. They should get some women to play, they could make gameplay last longer. I mean there's no rules against them playing.","I agree! The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average NFL and MBL players. That's surprising.","It is pretty surprising, but I guess you have to consider that most engineers work well into their 60s or even 70s. The average football player only plays for 3 years.","True. I wonder if other people outside of the U.S. get confused when they hear football since that's the word they use to call soccer.","I think a lot do. It just feels weird having to specify. Although Gridiron Football has a nice ring to it.","Yes it does. In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of that era. Things have changed since then.","Yeah they have.

A columnist at the Boston Globe called it a cult!","I can see the importaance of staying physically fit. I just dont think it should be mixed with religion. I think he is just trying to make some extra money off his popularity.","That seems likely. We often think of NFL players as making lots of $$$, but their careers are very short. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer are actually much higher than that of an NFL or MLB player.","Yeah but thoe number are just of the average player. Most players dont play very long and dont make a whole lot of money in football when you think about a lifetime. They only a play a year and make like half a milion dollars. An engineer has to work his whole life for that.

It's weird how much trauma there is in such a short time on the field. Did you know that the average NFL game has only 11 minutes of actual game play?","I did hear that. Thos 11 minutes are exciting though.","Yeah. Also, an engineer would make half a million dollars in 5-8 years, so that's not too shabby.

Those are extremely high scoring games. The highest ever was in 1916 and it was 222-0! How is that even possible?","I cannot imagine. In the two games I mentioned, they did not stop the clock in the second half to shorten the game. Have you heard that the Iowa visitor's dressing room is painted pink.","I did not. Is that supposed to be some kind of psychological game?","There have been studies that prove that weight lifters cannot lift as much in a pink room. So it is another move to win games.","Wow!

Here's another interesting football fact, there are only 11 actual minutes of gameplay in an average NFL game.","I never really enjoyed watching football. I think that might be the main reason, I don't have time to sit in front of the TV for three hours for just 11 minutes of play.","I like documentaries. I would like to see one about finding the Tower of Babel in Iraq.","My mental image of that is a very tall building, if it existed it was probably a lot smaller than I'm thinking.","It\\'s probably a bunch of rubble due to recent bombings. It\\'s interesting that Thomas Jefferson cut out the parts in his Bibel that referred to the \"supernatural\" (e.g., miracles).","I've heard that before.

I prefer the NFL to college football or any other league.","I was shocked to find out that an average NFL game, only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.","They do keep the time running while the teams are setting up & calling a new play a lot so I guess it's not too surprising. They still earn a lot of money for the little work they do.","How true. I read somewhere that the top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as the top football stars.","That shows how quickly things can change. Most pro football players don't have long careers. I wonder how much they make compared to other professions over their lifetime.","Well, I also read that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an average NFL player.","That's pretty interesting.

In the 60's it was pretty common for students to be required to read it. How things change.","Yes, I think if we went back to that practice, alot of things would def be different in America.","Maybe you're right.

It is exciting to see men in combat to the death. The outcomes are wagered as well I think.","True. It is probably due to injuries that force early retirement that based on average lifetime earnings, engineers get better paid than players.","Engineers must be very smart, maybe some of the most smart people.

Did you hear about them placing tracking ships in the players now?","I was reading about that, I wonder if they do that during the game or only practice.","I bet you they do it for both.

Maybe Cumberland would have benefited from a soothing, pink locker room when they lost 222-0.","Dunno... they did an experiment where they found that weight lifters couldn't life as much when placed in a pink room. But, that was like twenty years ago, so maybe the effect has worn off on people's minds. Wow, that's quite a loss!

Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?","Can't say that I've had the pleasure of his acquaintance.","Me either but he is a great player, a former QB who never fumbled the ball in his career","A QB that never fumbled?

What this Tom VS Time documentary about ?","It's a behind the scenes look at how he prepares himself both physically and mentally for the NFL season. He pretty much never takes a day off all year long.","Is it related to his TB12 Method ? Some find it a little creepy.","In some respects it is a little bit. You see some of the health and lifestyle decisions he makes in the documentary. He credits the TB12 Method book for helping him to stay on top of his game.","Don't you think he should stick to being a football player, and keep his advice to football and physical shape ?","That's a tough call because the book does focus on a heathy diet and lifestyle approach that would crossover to help in football.","Maybe your are right, you cannot really improve just one aspect of your life, your have improve most of them at the same time. It is nearly impossible just to improve your alimentation, if you have a toxic lifestyle.","True. Did you know that the highest score ever in a football game is when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0? That seems crazy that it was so high.","Yeah how would you feel if you were in the losing team ? I think I would just laugh it out.","I would throw my hands up and just think \"well I am here for the education after all\". lol","I don't think there is anything to learn from that loss, I just hope nobody got injured during it.","Yes I agree. Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football once during his NFL career. That's pretty impressive!","As long as he has played often, because I also never fumbled the football during my NFL career. What do you they do with all the data they gather from the sensors and chips they put in their equipment ?","I don't know. Seems a little like they are getting too analytical to me.","Maybe it is for television, like the yellow bar for the first down. I can't imagine watching football without it.","Didn't ESPN win an emmy for that?","Yeah, I think it was the kind of product that people needed but they did not know they needed it until it was shown to them.","True. In the 1960's top bowlers made 2 times as much money as the top football stars from that era. That number is probably different now.","Yeah, but still, the average lifetime salary of an engineer is higher that the one of a pro footballer, they earn a lot but just for a few years, I think it says a lot about how low the pro bowler salary is.","Yes. The engineers have a longer career which makes sense. It was nice chatting with you this morning!

So i not sure i care to read it really. i'll just stick to watching him make great plays.","We cannot talk about Tom Brady without talking about the football sport as a whole. Did you know that in the 1960s, Top Bowlers made twice as much as Professional football players? Imagine a bowler making twice the amount of Tom Brady!","Yeah that's weird however did you know his wife makes twice as much as him now?","No I did not. Wow! An engineer would make more than Tom Brady if you compared their lifetime earnings. That is probably due to how few years football can be played professionally.","Wow that is something but i'd rather do 10-15 and out with millions that 40-50.","Agreed. I just wanted to point out that women would be allowed to play in the NFL if they meet the league requirements.","I would love to see a women's league in football like the wnba.","The visitors locker room in the University of Iowa is painted pink. Talk about demoralizing!","Yeah i'm sure you right! Do you know what the highest scoring football game was.","No I do not, which one was it?","Cumberland and Georgia Tech back in 1916 the score was 220-0.","Do you know which football player never fumbled the ball once?","Wow that's quite an achievement, i think he played for the patriots right?","Yep, it was Green-Ellis who did it.

You?","Probably can't.","Had you heard that Tom Brady eats avocado ice cream? I didn't even know there was such a thing.","With all his cash, he can probably get any kind of (disgusting) ice cream he wants.","Yeah probably. Have you heard about his book?","His book on avocado ice cream? Is that a thing?","No the book is more about how he keeps healthy at 40 and his philosophy about life and football.","He probably has a bunch of followers who buy the book. Is it popular?","Well, they say it's a best seller. You sound like you're not a Tom Brandy fan.","I don't really know much about him. I know that he has won many Super Bowls. He married a model. that's it.","I think he is kind of full of himself, and while I'm not really a fan I can't help rooting for him because of his age. At my age I like to see old guys do well.","We all hope to retain the vigor of youth during our sunset years. Yet few of us have access to avocado ice cream.","No, but it sounds kind of good. I like avocado and I like ice cream. I've heard of worse combinations.","I guess I should try it before I judge it. Maybe Tom is onto a winning combination.","Well, he must be doing something right.

Same to you."],"emotion":["neutral","positive","interested"]},{"dialogue":["Hi, did you hear about the New England Patriots and Tom Brady?","Yes, I've heard quite a bit about them.

I'm interested to find out how spiritual things are connected to football. That seems strange to me.","I forgot where it is being broadcasted, do you know? Is it on TV or Netflix or something? Yeah me too, maybe there's some sort of thing he does that's revealed in the series that allows him to be such a great player!","It airs on Facebook Watch which you have to have a subscription to. It apparently looks at Brady's mental and physical preparation and his spiritaul side as well.","Oh well I don't have a subscription for that, do you? I wonder why they chose that platform to air it on. Yeah, my friend who has seen it told me it completely changed his opinion about the guy, he went from not liking him to actually thinking and respecting the guy.","Well, I don't have a subscription but i figure sooner or later Netflix will get it and I'll watch it then. With as much success as Tom Brady and the Patriots have gotten, you'd think he knows something that no one else is thinking about.","Oh that's true, I hope it does come on Netflix, it might even win an award, like when ESPN won an Emmy for using the yellow line in the games.","Yes, that could happen but think about what real success Tom and the Patriots are garnishing. The have a whole state on their side. Even churches in New England talk about the team on Sundays at the palpit. That's not something that's going on everywhere in the US.","Yeah, for people who aren't Patriots fans living in that area, I think their houses might be teepee'd or something or perhaps painted completely pink like what the University of Iowa did to the visiting football teams' locker rooms.","Yes, that could be, sometimes you don't want to feel the wrath of the opposing team. But, you have to admit that in last years Super Bowl, the Patriots pulled it out in overtime to win the game and that was very exciting, to say the least.","The super bowl game last year was entertaining and quite good, the TB12 method does work, do you know what the 12 in that term stands for?","No, what do you think it means?","Perhaps you're only allowed to eat 12 items per day in the diet?","No, I think it has to do with entire lifestyles of spirituality, fitness, nutrition, philosophies and stuff like that. Did you know that former Patriots RB Benjavus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career? Thats amazing.","Oh ok, or maybe it has something to do with Brady's jersey number which is 12, I think. That is impressive, perhaps the religion of the game or of Tom Brady helped him achieve that feat!","It could be that you are correct, I'm guessing myself. I do know that it sounds inspirational and like something other teams might want to participate in.that TB12 Method, I mean.","Yeah! do you think schools should require reading the bible as part of their educational curriculum?","It would not be a bad idea in my opinion.

Do you know what the highest score in college football is?","Yes, 222-0! Thats amazing. I wonder how bad your team must be to lose so handidly. Can you believe that Tom Brady really wants to keep playing?","Yeah most players his age are pretty much done at this point and hence I guess they make less money than engineers, their careers are shorter","That was interesting as well. I think there is one kicker who is like 47 who said he will keep playing. But with that, I guess you only have a few plays a game where you actually do anything.","Yeah exactly. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line?","I had seen that before somewhere. Technology has changed the game. I did not know that it was only 11 minutes of actual time.","Yeah it sure has. And yet when you think about it, we are glued to the tv for hours","We are. The super bowl is like 4 hours when you add in all the comcerials.

I didnt know most children read it up until the 1960s","I see. Yes I am surprised that it was part of the education system for that long Did you know Jefferson created his own version of the Bible?","Yes I did see that, it was fascinating to learn that. I also was interested in the translation of apple being the same as evil","yeah that is pretty cool.Roosevelt and Quincy also opted out of using the Bible to swear in","Suprised that its only been two of them. I wonder their reason","I bet you they were not religious and opted out of it. Do you know much about the Tower of Babel?","I dont. I was interested to look that up.

Do you have any guess as to what the highest score in football ever was?","Somewhere in the 70s? It's hard to imagine a game being such a high score when there's only eleven minutes of live gameplay!","Wow! That's an insanely small amount of gameplay. Georgia Tech Defeated Cumberland in 1916 with a score of 222-0!","Wow! That's insane! That would hurt my pride a lot but at what point in the game do you just call it quits?","Good question. I didn't know it was even possible to score that many points. It would just have to be constant scores.","Yeah exactly, did you know that the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from dining in the present of NFL players, such horrible treatment!","That's upsetting. I did hear about that. What really disgusts me is that is the cheerleader was there first and is already eating, she has to stop eating and leave. That makes me very angry. What's the point in that?","Yeah, why is there even such a rule, what benefit does it serve? I think, if anything, that rule just adds to the ego of football players.","I agree. Did you also know that there are tracking chips in players shoulder pads and the football?","Is it to track their speed and movement or impact of tackles perhaps?","It tracks velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location. Why do they not use these as part of making the calls? Why do they rely only on reviews when they have this technology?","Yeah that's a great point! I wonder if the agents use this data to negotiate better contracts and salaries for their players, it could be a great bargaining tool.","I agree. Since they are not doing any of this, it begs the question what are they doing with this data?","Probably selling it to people in this digital age and yet the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of the NFL player, any theories why that's the case?","I have no idea. That's the first I've heard of it. I'm surprised more people don't go for that then rather than hoping for a football career.

So I wonder if it was entirely a metaphor rather than a fruit at all?","I would think that's a good possibility. Earlier readers might have understood the play on words.","Interesting. By the way, the building that they believe the Tower of Babel is based on is the Etemenanki in Iraq.","That sounds reasonable. It would be located somewhere in the Middle East.

Maybe the chip in the ball can tell us.","You'd think that would already be known since the chips are supposed to tell velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location...but I wonder who gets that info and when?","Interesting.

It would be neat if there lights surrounding the end zone and when the chip broke the end zone the lights would flash or would be cheesy.","I think that would be cheesy and too alike to hockey.

They are tracking velocity and rotation and all that fun stuff","yeah that is pretty interesting how they do that. On a different note.

And Jefferson made his own version of the Bible. Wow","I heard that Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only two presidents that did not use the Bible at their swearing in ceremonies","I guess they were not religious.

That is a better profession for breast cancer awareness.","Yeah I guess so. Did you know women can play in the NFL?","That would be a good way to raise breast cancer awareness.

NO Saints must have had a problem with relations between players and cheerleaders to create a rule like that. No partying together. Something like that.","Yeah that makes sense.

Did you know that Baker Mayfield (University of Oklahoma QB) once considered quitting football to pursue full-time competitive gaming and claims to be able to beat anyone at his school one-on-one in Halo 3?","No, i didn't know that. The NFL puts chips in players shoulder pads, were you aware with that?","Yes, so they can track the players moves. They also put tracking chips inside the football as well.","Oh, that is pretty cool. I wonder what they do with all of that information?","I''m sure that it will give the players more game play time.

If they had taken a firm stand either way it would have had an effect on the protests. I think that the anthem should be reserved for government functions only and that the Pledge of Alliegence should be limited to those taking office.","I would disagree. The Anthem and the Pledge are important ways we as a people build our cultural identity. It should be a source of unity in our diversity. Do you think national identity and unity are important?","I do. But is that National identity to be forced onto us by reciting a script of words or is the realization of individual rights more important? Are we a country that subscribes to those rights or are we a nation of mindless followers? Sorry, I don't mean to preach,","No offense taken. Ideally, the lyrics and the script should reflect the rights we hold in common. I'm curious, which words or phrases do you think are inappropriate? Are there any that relate to the core of the protests, about bail or law enforcement disparities?","From the constitution: All men are created equal. That is a statement that has been shoved aside too many times. Minorites, the poor or disadvantaged are purposely overlooked by many in our government.","Agreed. But isn\\'t that a reason to better emphasize and adhere to things like the Pledge? \"... with liberty and justice for all\". Or the Anthem: \"the land of the free\".","Only if those same words are believed in and adhered to by everyone, including those in power.

Apparently you can pick it up on your AM radio in the car, I'll have to try that next time","The storms on Jupiter are probably better than a lot of things on the radio. Like news broadcasts in Latin, for instance.","Haha that's what I was thinking too. Or Canadian radio for that matter. You need at least 40% of the radio in Canada to be of Canadian origin. I can't think of any good Canadian artists off the top of my head","Rush, April Wine, Bryan Adams, Neil Young are a few popular ones. Then there's Bieber.

I think that Kenny Stabler was also a leftie but that was long ago.","I think I remember him. A cool fact is that the circular huddle used today is because of Paul D. Hubbard. He was a deaf Quarterback and they started huddling that way so the defense could not see his hand signals.","I had heard that. I wonder how he handled the snaps? Maybe just touched the center. How about Alex Smith, not only a great QB but also very smart.","Yes he was. I think he took enough AP tests in high school to enter college as a Junior.","Amazing man. Did you play FB in school? I was raised in Fairbanks Ak and the snow didn't totally disappear until @ May 1st, school let out mid May so it would have been a very short season.","No, I played basketball.

I found it odd that the dinosaurs were only on the screen for 15 minutes. Must have had a small CGI budget.","Yeah, Im guessing its a expensive production overall, theres a cool fact and theyy used elephant roars for the t-rex","Really? I recently heard that dinosaurs had really small and meek roars. Not at all like what is projected at movies or on TV.","Maybe they projected it this way so that they would sound scarier, also velociraptors were smaller than projected in movies.","Did you see that the park ride cost more than the movie to make?","No I actually didnt see that, os are you a dinarour fan?

What was Pratt's joke?","He joked about getting the part in 2010 for Jurassic Park 4","Wow! That is like a premonition. I guess I will make a joke about winning Power Ball. I guess you know that the raptors are not computer generated, but are people in dinosaur suits?","Really? they fooled me, I thought that was the computer, it sure takes a long time to render one frame of the T-Rex dinasaur","I suppose that is because of the raindrops and water dripping from T-Rex.","The detail is impressive I guess thats why it takes so long to render them","I think so too.

I remember I liked it, but I don't remember it being an A rating. Also it's hilarious that Legos replaced Ferrari as Brand Finances world's most powerful brand. Maybe these companies are targeting children as their next target audience?","I would say these companies are really smart. The brands not only target children but all ages. Where a ferrari can only be used by adults, Legos can be used and reused by people of all ages and can be reconstructed into different shapes. And man i wish i worked for Lego and got one of those golden bricks did you hear about that?","I didn't hear about that. That's crazy. I think it's cool that they care about the people that have invested time into their company. Lego is dope. They are infiltrating everything. Movies, amusement parts, living room floors. Also it's cool how they partnered with whoever owns the rights to batman. Seems like a legit company but its weird that Rotten tomatoes gives certain movies such high ratings while other historical informative movies get a low rating. Like I understand that it's boring, but damn.","I think its crazy how all of these large companies or websites started. Take Rotten Tomatoes, I remember it from high school it was in its infancy and to think it was created by 3 undergrad college kids. The concept is so simple but so great. I know as a young adult I didn't want to have to rely on the older critics for movie reviews to decide if I wanted to see a movie, but like you said with Spykids getting a higher rating the the almighty Batman i'm not so sure about all the scores on this website either lol.","Oh. That makes sense. If it was us rating the movie at a young age, then it would get a higher rating than the Abraham Lincoln movie. Makes sense. Because of the internet, anyone is allowed to place their opinion on certain subjects. Democracy.","Speaking of Batman, he is my favorite superhero!! He appeared in the 27 Detective Comics in 1939. What is so great about Batman is that he doesn't have powers, but is brute strength and genius intellect.","They have come a long way. They've created tons of DC movies. So is Batman is the same universe as Aquaman? Like how everyone in Marvel is now in one movie... is that the same thing? I wonder if there is a connection with Lego and Batman. I know that Marvel doesn't own spiderman and has to lease the rights in order to make the movie... there are so many different spidermans.","I'm not sure if they are in the same universe all of that is so convoluted. I actually didn't get into the comics like that but I do know DC is trying to create the same type of universe as Marvel but its not quite working out. Batman had a hilarious villain though he had one called condiment king and he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup.","True. I know that Marvel is owned by Disney so they have their stuff together. Yeah, I kind of feel bad for DC comics but If they stick with it hopefully they can build a strong team. That's hilarious. And really weird and creative and I honestly would love to see that made into a movie. Especially because I feel like my generation is into weird stuff.","I take it you are a millennial I remember growing up with all of the cartoons in the morning on Saturdays and in the afternoons after school so there is definitely a market for batman and I'm still going back to the rating on rotten tomato for the movie I cannot believe that it wasn't like an A rating. Adam West even has a batman logo on one of his molars how awesome is that?","I am. Same. I always check rotten tomatoes and if its a splat then I'm not wasting my time. Sometimes I read stuff by critics and I'm like... youre the worst. Also in film school everyone says the same crap and its annoying. Yes Bugs Bunny is the best. I remember watching the one where they're like... children bunnies.. I don't know. Thats crazy dedication to Adam west! Have you seen the one with Ben Affleck?","No, I refuse to watch it I'm on some weird strike. hahahaha I need to see it just so I can have an intelligent argument. I really like the Christian Bale I thought he was a great Batman but from what i hear Ben Affleck was a great Bruce Wayne. I cannot wait to see the new joker by Joaquin Phoenix i want to see if the saying holds true that face to face batman and joker never mention each other by name.","hahaha. I totally understand. TBH I don't remember anything special about it. I also don't remember the plot which is crazy because... shouldn't they all have the same plot. Yeah I only remember Bain because I highkey love Tom Hardy. Terrible, I know. Oh wow Joaquin should be bomb. He's a great actor. I wonder if there is a significance to them not calling each other by name. I wonder if the Lego Batman movie got a good Rotten Tomatoes rating. I bet you it did. I hope I create something one day as successful as the three undergraduate students. Are they all asian? Of course. I'm only part asian so... not looking great.","Yes I wish I came up with something like that as well. Were you aware that Weird al yankovic did some voiceover work on the most recent animated batman vs robin","Sure did. From Factual sectional 3. Before that, I did not. Do you think he started as a voice actor then became famous after or vice versa?","You know it wouldn't surprise me if that was the way it happened with the different songs he comes up with.","He surely is animated. haha... it's too late. I like that Lego is trying to do away with plastic. Like how Batman tries to do away with crime.

I think I remember something about spiderman getting married. Do you?","No I don't. Did he get married in one of the movies?","I think so. The original spiderman got married to mary jane. 1987 i think? They did a whole public thing for it if I remember right.","Well that's good. I use to be a fan of Spider Man back in the day and him marrying her is good! Oh! That makes me think of Stan Lee's cameo in one of the movies. He's standing on a street with Peter Parker and tells him that one man can make a difference! How cool is that?","That is very cool! I liked Stan Lee. I think the first spiderman made Stan Lee something like 800 million in revenue, but he didn't get any of it!","That's so unfair! He created something important. I mean, the military is even trying to achieve spider man like abilities.","Wouldn't that be something to see! Have you seen Thor? I tried to watch it but had a hard time following it.","I have see Thor and I really liked it. I was impressed with the cast, especially that Anthony Hopkins was in it.","What? I guess I didn't watch it long enough for that! Tom hiddleston tried out for Thor, instead he got Loki.","I've heard that before. I heard he had to put on 50 pounds of muscle too.","I can't even imagine working that hard for a role and not getting it! I did watch Ironman all the way thru. How bout you?","I not only watched all the way through but watched all Iron Man movies. I thought Robert Downy Jr. did an outstanding job!","I thought so too! I did think he was a little too skinny for the role though! He is so small! Genyth Paltrow was amazing too. What was her name in it? Apple or something?","I didn't notice. I don't remember her name but she did do good. The whole Iron Man story is so cool. A super rich guy that is intelligent and builds things and becomes a hero?!","And he does it for everyone else too! I can't believe the first iron man came out almost 11 years ago!","I know! It seems like it was just a few months ago! I did sort of hate to see Jeff Bridges as the bad guy."],"emotion":["positive","excited","wowed"]},{"dialogue":["I was sad to see Stan Lee passed away. The Marvel movies just won't feel right without his cameos.","I think my all-time favorite was his Amazing Spider-Man appearance, where he was wearing the headphones as everything explodes behind him","That was a good one as well, or the one when he drink a cup of a drink and has Hulks blood in it.","That one is such a visceral memory for me, because he makes such a memorable sound when he tastes the kick to his bottle. He really knew how to set up the brand!","He sure did, my favorite hero is Iron Man I loved it ever since 2008 I think Robert Downey Jr is a great actor.","Oh yes, the Iron Man movies really launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe into what it is today. My personal favorite in the films is Thor I think.","Thor is a great character as well, did you know 80% of the dialogue in Thor Ragnarok was improvised?","That's incredible, because I completely love how it turned out. I just learned that Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki was originally screen testing to play Thor, but I think Chris Hemsworth really nailed the character.","He did and Tom Hiddleston really nailed the Loki character as well, I think Loki stole the movie and the protagonism.","He really did, which is so true to the comics. The first Thor by Kenneth Branagh just didn't use the support characters enough. Thor was never meant to be only about Thor, but his whole team of characters.","I haven't seen those, but yeah, it's too bad Spider-Man movies haven't had a continuity but they keep on pulling new actors for the roll.","Marvel has always had a lot wrapped up in the Spider-Man character as their flagship for their younger audience. I'm not surprised their movies are all over the place too.","Did you know the military is trying to emulate Spidermans abilities for their soldiers?","No that's crazy. That sounds like another Marvel gimmick honestly. They created a whole stunt wedding with actors when they married off the character in the 80s.","Could be, sounds really difficult to alter humans to have similar abilities as Spiderman, it can be really dangerous, and I didnt hear about the 80s stunt, can you tell me a bit more?","Just that they pretended to marry Peter Parker off to Mary Jane in the real world and let Stan Lee officiate. There he is again, knowing just how to create a wild brand stunt.","Oh I see, interesting, and yeah, I see your point that definitely sells movies or at least creates interest in them.","The fact that he was so well-known and considered a comic legend just shows how effective he was at those spots. Before Iron Man was released in 2008, many people didn't even realize comics were still being published.","I can imagine after all the whole Marvel franchise is live because of him and will keep on living long after his death.","He really gave them the right boost to start!"],"emotion":["loving","sadness","negative","sad"]},{"dialogue":["Hello, do you like superhero movies?","Nice. Have you seen Spider-Man, any of them","Yes I've seen the first Spider-man movie in 2002 where Stan Lee made a cameo where he saved a little girl when a building exploded.","Nice.

Are they going to have soldiers bitten by radioactive spiders to give them super abilities?","I guess we will have to wait and see how that whole plan that they seem to have develops","Have you watched any of the Thor movies?","I have actually, the 2011 one. Did you know antman made the debut in Thor?","Wow I never knew that antman was in the Thor movie. I do remember that Ildris Elba played one of the gods in it and a bunch of white supremacists were upset a black man played the part.","Yeah apparently Antman was in other superhero movies like Spider-man, Hulk and Iron-man.","Did antman play in the first Ironman movie? The same movie that Jeff Bridges was in?","I am not sure even which one he played in, I must not have been paying attention. Did you know Tom Hidleston originally auditioned for the role of Thor and not Loki","That's amazing. I never knew that. I don't think he was good for that part. I recall that the Odin's ravens from the Thor movie was in the Avengers movie when Thor and Loki were arguing on the mountain top.","Yeah and he even went on to gain 50 pounds of muscle to make sure that he is set for the role of Thor","Stan Lee made a cameo in Thor: The Dark World. He was trying to get into a party if I recall.","The man was a legend for sure. He got 10% of all profits on his characters","Yeah he did lots of tours around the country going to comic conventions. He died recently at the age of 95.","Yeah, he had a great career. Do you know who performed the opening of spider-man back in 1990?","Spider-man in 1990? That is a bit before my time. Was it made by the same studio that makes them now? I do know that in the mid 90s James Cameron was supposed to make a Spider-man film with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Leonardo Dicaprio.

It was nice chatting with you :)"],"emotion":["conversational","positive","satisfied"]},{"dialogue":["Hi, how are you?","I am well. I like spider man. I also like the X-men.

I think I would rather wear an Iron Man suit, or exoskeleton as it's called.","Or have telekinetic powers like some other characters.","That could be great too. It could be good to have the weapons they have like Thor's hammer or the Infinity Gauntlet.","I would like Captain America's power and just have the ripped body and super strength. Not too assuming but bad a$$.","That would be nice. In real life I guess people don't look like that. The guy that played Loki in Thor had to gain 50 pounds of muscle.","Really? He seemed so slight in the movie. How much did he weigh before?","I don't know and I agree with you. He did look thin. I guess maybe Chris Hemsworth, Thor in the movie, was really big in comparison.","Stan lee gets 10% of all net profits based on his characters? He died a rich man!","I imagine that he did at that! His movies are hugely popular, so much so that the best of actors work in them. Look at Anthony Hopkins acting in Thor!","did you know that Dr Octopus swapped consciousness with spiderman?","I never knew that! I wonder what happened to Spiderman by doing it.","Not sure. But it is Dr Oc in the superior spider man series. Weird...","That is weird. Maybe the writers left it for Spider man to become a bad guy. Stan Lee probably had something in mind. I always liked him. I especially liked that he had cameo roles in all of his movies.","I always go into the movies looking for him. Always fun to see where they put him.","I think one of my favorites was when he worked as a fedex guy delivering a package for tony Stank in iron man.","That was good.

Harry Potter was born on July 31st, 1980 and the entire series takes place throughout the 90s. I didn't know that.","I am surprised to hear this too. It was the most banned book so far in the 21st Century.","Wow! Harry Potter books were translated from British to American English.","No wonder it has become so popular in the US. The books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.","That's incredible! Robin Williams wanted to play Hagrid in the Harry Potter movies, but was turned down because J.K. Rowling and director Chris Columbus only wanted British and Irish actors.","Oh, I've never heard that. That is pretty surprising. Almost as surprising as Rowling being the first billionaire to fall off the Forbes billionaire list because of charitable giving.","Wow. I would say kudos to her for doing that. J.K. Rowling was asked to use her initials instead of her full name because her publishers were worried that boys wouldn't want to read a book written by a woman. That sounds so absurd to me.","I feel the same way. That is absurd that she was asked to do that. I've been to Universal and seen a bit of the HP attraction. Rowling can go there and tell them to change anything incorrect.","That's interesting! Do you like snakes at all? I'm afraid I don't like them. lol","No way! They are creepy!

Did you know there are no Walmarts in NYC?","That's not surprising. I wonder if that's due more to space or to population. I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with politics","I think it was because the unions don't want them there.","I can see that.

I would say that Disney invests for the long term. They believe in quality.","Yes they do! have you watched any movies created by Disney? Bill Nye was a science consultant for the movie Flubber.","I never saw Flubber, though I think it was made a couple time. Why Bill Nye? I figure there must be others that know more than he does.","I would think so also, but one of my favorite Disney movies is Beauty and the Beast.","I saw that a long time ago. Great songs! It probably won many awards.","Yes! The film grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film.","Hm. I thought it was animation. I guess you mean the remake? I never saw that. It was probably great as well.","Yep, in 2017 they remade Beauty and the Beast. Celine Dion reluctantly agreed to sing the theme to Beauty and the Beast, but doing so really put her on the map!","I guess she was perfect for the song. She has a great voice. I wonder why she was reluctant.","I agree, she has a great voice. One American actor I really like is Morgan Freeman.","He has a great voice. His narration is spot on. A lot of gravitas. I loved him in Batman.","The Dark Knight was good! Morgan is a great guy, he started mentoring Samuel L. Jackson in his early acting career.","I did not know that! He really is a great guy off screen too then. I hope he's around for a long time.","So do I! I guess in 2008 Morgan Freeman got in a car accident. Due to nerve damage in his left hand, he plays golf one-handed!","He plays one-handed golf? LOL. I guess the man loves his golf.","Yes that is dedication! Have a good day!","Thanks! You too!","Thank you!"],"emotion":["positive"]},{"dialogue":["hi how are you doing? Do you like morgan freeman?","no, i did not. what role did he play?","He played the godfather. Movie was ok. Kind of a Alice in Wonderland meets Cirque du Soleil feel. And per Disney's usual... it had a strong female lead. Morgan Freeman's been in some better stuff.","yeah, people love him so he gets cast a lot. i suppose my favorite film of his is shawshank. that was great. which film of his do you like?","OMG! Shawshank is my favorite. Loved his character Red.","Yes, i think that originally Brad Pitt was supposed to be dufresne. i though the chemistry between morgan and tim was great.","Yeah, can't see anyone by Tim Robbins in that role.

He was on TV originally. on the electric company.","I think I remember that! Vaguely remember him dancing in a kind of knitted sweater. Amazing how he started on that kids show to become an Academy Award winning actor!","yeah, he loved acting. i think he was in the military, then went to college to study acting. interesting guy.","Love his voice. Surprised he hasn't done more voice acting for cartoons. Think he voices a character in the Lego movie. Is that a Disney flick?","yes, he was in the batman movies, maybe they wanted him to voice a character like that? He would do great voices for animation.","Considering he just did a Disney movie I'd figure they'd want to utilize his skills. Disney's got money to spend. Heard the company makes about $1,110 per second!","yes, i wish i could buy their stock. they will always be a money maker. .they make quality films and the theme parks are great.","Yeah, my kids are always watching some Disney movie. My daughter loves the live action Beauty and the Beast.","Really? is it better than the animated version? the songs were great in that?","They used the same songs. I personally liked the animated version better. Think what appeals to my daughter is Emma Watson. She also love Harry Potter movies.","Yes, she is a talented actress. I bet she did a great job.

That makes sense. the same man composed music to little mermaid, beauty and the beast, aladdin, pocahontas, hunchback of notre dame, and hercules. Thats awesome.","Alan Menken, I think.

I cannot think of more iconic film than Disney.","Totally agree with you. The Oscars themselves were even nominated for nine Emmys in 2013!","How funny. I wonder if they won any. When it comes to Oscars I do not think anyone has been nominated more than Meryl Streep. Often described as the \"best actress of her generation.\"","Yeah she really is a great actress. She even has an actress daughter who plays the FBI agent on Mr. robot.","Meryl Streep has been nominated for 21 Academy Awards, only won three. She was nominated for 31 Golden Globe nomination, won eight.","Incredible!

It is so great and makes me very hungry each time I watch it","I don't think I've seen it but I will add it to my list. Another good actress is Emma Watson. I thought she was so good in the Harry Potter series.","I love the Harry Potter films. I think it is adorable that the director of Prisoner of Azkaban made the actors write essays about their characters. Emma wrote 16 pages, Daniel Radcliffe turned in a page and Rupert Grint forgot his.","That is hilarious! Emma almost considered not playing Hermione in The Half Blood Prince. That would have been devastating for the series.","I am so glad that she decided to continue. She said she could not watch someone else play the role and I am not sure if I could either.","Yes I agree with her. Emma is also a certified yoga teacher! I would love to take her class.","Me too.

Blazing Saddles won 3 times, I have no idea what movie that even is lol. I guess I have some investigating to do.","Me too. leonardo decaprio is a real actor yet eminem has won more awards.","I agree, all of the actors listed are definitely more deserving.

The video game cost more to make than the original movie.","I did see that movie. I liked the first one more, I also played the video game as well!

It\\'s rated R, and that\\'s not my thing, especially with my family. I don\\'t protest the theaters.","Exactly, free will is a good thing and should keep it that way. I don't go to see most of the superhero movies because I don't think they are good, I don't protest.","Do you think that there is an element where such shaming's should be employed? Would it be crossing the line if I said humiliating criminals who have committed heinous crimes should be allowed? What do you think?","Im up for free content creation for whatever, unless it is supporting to do some sort of criminal behavior like organizing a mob to riot or something.","That makes sense. So if Harmon was trying to recruit time travelers to do what he was showing ... that would be bad enough?","Yeah who knows, but you know how sensitive people are even to stuff that isn't remotely bad.","Is there a way, do you think, to reverse this trend? Or do you think it's going to get worse, and famous people will just start to quit or neuter their social media?","I think it will just continually get worse. People are more and more PC each day. You really can't have an opinion unless it's the right one these days.","Yes ... sad. What opinion of yours would you share on social media if you felt you wouldn't be mobbed?","That is a very good question. I don't think I know. Maybe just how PC everything has become and that you really can't have an opinion or express it without being hated by someone.","Hahaha, good point. It\\'s even \"offensive\" to say that things are too PC! I think there might be more variety coming out of hollywood (tv and movies) if censorship like this wasn\\'t a concern. We\\'re going on Toy Story 8? (jk) Disney just plays it safe, like getting rid of Rosanne.","Yeah I agree with you on that.

I did hear that Robert Downey Jr. was on the set of the Avengers and he would hide food on the sets.","Haha I wonder why he was hiding food?","I don't know why he would do that but apparently nobody was ever able to find it so they let him continue to do it. The scenes where he is eating blueberries and shawarma are unscripted and are part of the collection of food that he hid. Maybe they'll make a video game of it and put it in there as part of the role playing of his character.","That is hilarious! He seems like a cool guy.","Yes, I like Robert Downey Jr., too. Actually, did you know that Hollywood uses a measurement called 'q' scores to determine the likability of celebrities?","No I had no idea that was a thing, it's kind of ridiculous.

Obviously money making is key in their relationship.","Kayne does a lot of things for ratings. I wonder if he really likes Trump for example.

So much talent there...","And, I think she is one of the few to follow-up with a win after giving birth. She has been ranked No.1 for 319 weeks which ranks her third among the all time female tennis greats!","I was surprised to learn that she is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins. I wonder if she even likes football or if it's an investment.","I did not know that. I\\'m not sure if football is the best investment these days, considering its declining viewership and being embroiled in the \"kneeling\" controversies. But, maybe in the long haul, it will pan out.

Seems like tens of millions follower her on social media, hanging on her every word.","Caitlyn Jenner when she was an accomplished athlete but the rest? She's made over $53M so far for what?

At one point the Superman character had the power of facial contortion allowing him to disguise himself as anyone.","Yeah it's weird that he used to be able to change himself.

I always thought it was Chicago but probably cause they film there for the Nolan movies lol. I wonder how people can actually register themselves as a superhero. Can you believe there is 300 people registered??","Yeah maybe. And no, that is weird.

Tom cruise made 75 million off of mission impossible 3","Tom cruise vandalized the world's tallest building in 2010. during the filming of mission: impossible 4, he climbed to the top of the burj khalifa (without safety equipment) and etched katie holmes' name into the spire.","yeah, you can see that on you tube... sounds like a super hero to me! LOL","you're not Tom Cruise are you? :) Cruise starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning drama Rain Man.","LMAO... NO!

Iron Man series was pretty good. I didnt know that Garfield had a superhero series, should make a movie where Garfield takes on Black Panther. 2 cats enter, 1 cat leaves","lol now that is a good idea for a crossover, it's weird that Stan Lee wrote 15 DC comics though, I know he was famous for creating Marvel characters","Yeah thought he was only Marvel too","have you heard of the superhero called normalman? he sounds interesting, he was born on a planet of superheros but has no superpowers","Never heard of \"Normalman\". Would he be considered one the of 300 registered superheros in the United States?","haha thats a good question cuz he has not superpowers! have you ever seen a Mission Impossible movie?","yeah, I think I saw the last one. I usually try to watch those when they come out. Tom Cruise although a little \"kooky\" IMO still is a good actor.","lol he is kind of weird, its crazy that he made 75 million for the 3rd movie","yeah, that's a lot of money even for an actor. I knew he did some of his own stunts but climbing the tallest building without safety equipment, that's crazy","that is crazy, he even hung off the side of an airplane at 5000 ft, he's definitely brave!","I remember the old mission impossible series with I think his name was Peter Graves","yes you're right, I remember the first movie came out in 1996, I think that was my favorite one","yeah first one was really good.

I never really got into Pokemon. I know that it's really popular, just never followed it. You see that Tom Cruise threatened to sue that hovercraft inventor","haha wow didn't hear about that, I know that he plays Ethan Hunt in the Movies though, he does a great job in my opinion","That's really surprising that Seinfeld has a net worth more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined.","wow thats impressive! again though, Cruise seems kinda eccentric, he spent 10 million dollars on a bunker to protect himself from aliens lol"],"emotion":["positive","interesting","neutral"]},{"dialogue":["Hi, Do you read comic books?","Nah, I learned some things about them recently, and it's more varied than I thought.

I could probably name 12.","I assume dthere would be hundreds more, there are so many comic books, like Antman, Waspman, such random guys.","Yes, I suppose there are a lot. There are a lot of movies based on super heroes. When I was a kid I watched superman after school.","Which is your favorite?","I am not sure. I think I like Batman because he has that cool car. And I like Wonder Woman too.","Do you prefer Marvel or DC? I heard they're very different styles of superhero.","I guess Marvel because they are the only ones I remember from my childhood. How about you?","I actually like one from Dark Horse that's about a Samurai, it's not exactly superhero though","That's OK I used to love Archie. I was in grade school and they were all cool high school kids.","Did you know there was a superhero comic about Garfield?","I like Garfield. I didn't know that. He is a cool cat and so laid back.","I always found it a little weird. But Odie was cute. Odie as a superhero would be fun","I would read that. I like super heroes that are surprises-they look like Odie. I do not care for Tom Cruise, though.","Yeah i really dislike him, I don't think he's a good actor. He got mad at this other guys for having a similar name to him.","Good thing his name isn't John Smith, he would be mad all the time. Anyways, that's not his real name. It's Maypother.He looks like a Maypother too.","That's bizarre, I have never heard that name before. I guess it wasn't cool enough for him.","Actors should keep their real names. Except Meryl Streep. That is not a name I would want on a billboard.","Very few of them do, or at least they didn't used to.

That award he won was the only he has won.","Right, do you have a man bun?","I might if I was a man. :) Did you see the movie Thor?","I have, it was really good. Not to be awkward but the reason I asked about the hair was because of the hockey player that risked it all for his.","How did he risk it all for his man bun? That is hysterical.","Oh it was because of some tradition on their team. He did pretty well after he did them and got 16 points in 42 games.","Not bad. I see hockey on my list but not that story. A hockey players was traded for only 1 dollar in 1993 and went on to win 4 stanley cups. I don't know his name though.","I'm not sure where I saw that, I must have misread that article. I wonder what that is adjusted for inflation. I'm surprised they lose 8 pounds a game!","Adjusted for inflation would probably be about a dime now. I think gas was still hovering around 1 dollar a gallon around 1993 if I remember right. Yes. That is a lot of weight to lose for a game.

So did you know that in 1924 in the first Olympic games Canada scored 132 goals in the entire competition.","Wow is that considered a lot i don't watch hockey?","I would say a strong yes. In 1993 a hockey player was traded for $1 and went on to win 4 Stanley cups.","Wow that sounds disgraceful but he showed them. So the hockey ring remains under the basketball court when switching stadiums. weird you think it be the other way around.","He sure did! So, moving on, I like Leo Decaprio. He started on TV in 1980, and was born in '74 so he was just a little guy.","Yeah he is a pronominal actor. Apparently he is producing a twilight zone movie.","I like him. I did not realize he was a Growing Pains actor.","Yeah he was the friend right?","I think so. Are you a Thor fan?","Yes indeed he is so funny, ive seen all three have you?","I have not. What do you know about the show that would make me like it?","Not familiar with any shows he's done but the Avengers is making history.","Okay. If I am right he is a 2011 American superhero from Marvel.","Yes i'm sorry i though you knew who he was.

I think everyone is fairly concerned with how they look at that age, right?","I suppose you're right, especially if appearance plays a big role in their career. The man bun was all the craze in November of 2015 if you believe Google Trends.","Oh yeah, a whole bunch of celebrities got in on it. Leo DiCaprio, Jared Leto... I know there were others...","He has a lot of other things to focus on trying to adjust to the smaller rinks of the NFL. I guess the Sweedish Hockey league has bigger rinks.","I wonder how they compare to the rinks in Canada. One of their national sports is hockey, after all.","Yeah. The NHL and Canada have some differences too. He may have some issues with Lou Lamoriello of the New York Islanders. He prefers clean cut players.","Do you think there's a good reason why?","I suppose, but it seems rigid if you ask me.","It probably has a lot to do with the culture of a bunch of guys stick checking each other, and not so much helmet safety.","Yeah. Well, Jonsson-Fjallby's induction to the big stage during play offs drew U.S. and Canada's attention for sure.","He's originally from Sweden, right?","Yes. He played for the Swedes and made a game-winning goal to get to the finals. In the end they lost to Canada.","Canadian hockey is hardcore. Canada's performed well ever since the start of the modern Olympics back in the 20s.","That legendary first olympics when Canada score 132 goals to their opponents three was incredible.","Yeah, exactly! I'm not surprised that Canada beat them in the end.","Yep. Say, did you hear that there was a hockey player who was traded for only $1 in 1993?","Oh really? How'd that work out?","The team who traded him had to have been livid when he went on to win four stanely cups. Talk about embarrassing for the trading team.","Oh man, $1 for a handful of Stanleys is pretty great. Do you think his hair was long and fabulous like Axel's?","He probably had a lot of attitude coming off that type of trade, so I would be surprised.

I've heard that students at Cornell have to pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate.","i wonder where that came from. maybe other colleges require the same sort of things, i dunno.","I am not sure but it does seem like a good idea. Interestingly enough, golf requires water as well as swimming. The average golf course in america uses around 312,000 gallons of water each day.","isnt that a waste of water? I figure we need to grow crops with that. hm.","It does seem like a large amount going to waste. Then again, there is a course in Dubai that uses 4,000,000 gallons of water every day.","why is there a golf course in the desert? that makes no sense to me. they probably desalinate ocean water too. very expensive.","You know, I bet you are right about that. Dubai is for the wealthy so they probably do spend money on that. Say, did you know that Babe Ruth was not only great at baseball but also at golf?","i did not know that. i wonder what led him to playing golf. i guess he was interested in all sports.","Maybe so. Do you like to read? Have you read any of Mark Twain's works?","i love to read. havent read twain in a while. he is great. read him in high school.","Me too. You know he had some highly intelligent friends. One of which was Nikola Tesla. The two were reported to be best friends.","that is amazing. i didnt think those two would be sympatico because they have such different interests. thats great","I know what you mean. I think because of his writings Twain has always come across as simple and yet there's a lot more to him than in his books come to find out.","yeah, he wrote a lot of letters too. made a lot of speeches. great orator.","True. Here's some odd considering all that he has done. Thomas Edison filmed the only known footage of him.","ok, that makes sense. at the time movie cameras were not abundant. i bet there are many photos of him though.","Maybe, I would just think that someone other than Edison would film him. I mean, he's friends with Tesla and Edison is the only person to film him. I find that interesting.","i guess edison wanted to show off his invention? twain was a celebrity and would draw attention to the invention too. Anyway, great chat!","Oh great point!

I wonder what the two of them talked about.","I don't know but it's obvious Twain was intelligent. I mean, Edison had the only known filmed footage of him so Twain must have ran in some pretty smart circles.","He was a friend of presidents, artists, and royalty. I guess he always had something to do on a Saturday night. I wonder when he found time to write.","I always pictured him as moving slow and sitting around but I guess he was a very busy man. Who knew Hannibal, Missouri could produce such industrious talent.","I guess it was Hannibal's turn. Every town gets a turn, so they've had theirs. I wonder if the US will ever have a talent as prodigious as Twain.","I don't know. Seems like the US is focusing on athletics. They've won as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined.","That's great, but really, we need the whole country taking care of its health. The obesity epidemic is a catastrophe waiting to happen.","Before we can do that we need to change society and laws. Society needs to be focused on moving around and the laws need to make health care affordable. Cornell University is moving in the right direction though. They make all of their students pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate.","I know that MIT does the same thing. Something about someone drowning that compelled the school to impose a swimming requirement.","Well at least the students are getting some exercise. There are countries that make swimming part of the education curriculum.","Swimming is good exercise. Walking is, too. Have you played golf? I never considered it much of a sport, especially compared to swimming.","No I never have. It doesn't seem like much of a sport to me either.","I guess it a relaxing way to spend time outdoors, unless you've got money riding on it. It seems a bit expensive for average folk. Plus a huge waste of water.","Oh definitely a waste of water! Dubai has a golf course that uses 4,000,000 gallons of water a day!","Dubai is the perfect climate for a golf course! The sport was invented in Scotland, where there's plenty of water.","You know i always pictures Scotland having a lot of hills, marshes, and mountains but I guess it makes sense. Golf has you go through different terrains.","In that climate, I guess either you sit around indoors drinking and arguing, or you go on the golf links and argue.","I guess so! Golf takes a long time to play to so you can have a long time to argue.

I was asking if you had seen westworld, its really good to.","I have seen that. I like that one alot too! I was just looking and I see there is another famous connection in GOT. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is in it. I never knew those fact.","The singer Ed Sheeran was in an episode of game of thrones also, he was with a group of guys sitting around a fire singing in season 7.","I do remember reading that somewhere. There is a National Geographic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions just like the GOT characters. lol","I have seen that show a few times it is actually pretty good, you wouldn't think a show just following lions would work but it is actually really interesting.","I'm going to have to watch it to see it. I'm intrigued. GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.","I t one of the most expensive shows on television so that is pretty crazy that Ireland pays for it, but then again it also makes a ton of money, people subscribe to HBO for that show alone.","I work with people who can get enough of it. Were you ever a Star Wars fan?","I love the original 3, the prequels were not as bad as people let on, and the newer ones are kind of meh in my opinion, The force awakens was really good but the last Jedi was terrible, mainly because I hated how they did Luke Skywalkers death.","I would have to see I agree with you on all points. I wonder if Luke really died though? Be curious to see how they wrap up it all up in the last episode. The entire franchise had done over $8.5 billion dollars at the box office!","Oh yeah they make money hand over fist, but i have a feeling a lot of that is due to nostalgia from older generations who loved the originals.","Yes. The entire franchise is valued at $65 billion if you include everything else besides just the movies.","Yeah but it is sad that it is valued so high yet the guy who did the voice of Chewbaca, Peter Mayhew, made almost nothing for voicing the character and got none of the royalties from the originals either.

I personally like the first three but don't like the rest of them","Yes I like the Deadpool movie more than the new Star Wars movies personally. I think that Lucas was a genius though. He gave up some of his directing fee to get the licensing for the first movie, and then became a billionaire after that","Wow, that's incredible. Guess it paid off for him! Unlock Al Pacino, who actually turned down the role for Han Solo. I guess his career still took off, but still.","Yeah he still did fine haha. But I wonder how different Star Wars would have been if he were chosen instead. I also think it's interesting that Star Wars has been dubbed into Navajo. Definitely not a major language but an interesting one nonetheless","That's definitely cool! Evidently Christopher Walken was considered for the role of Han Solo, as well!","Wow now that would be really different LOL, do you know that George Lucas's wife at the time, Marcia Lucas, was actually responsible for a lot of things that made the original Star Wars film good? Things like Obi-Wan's death and Leia's good luck kiss. She also re-edited the Trench Run of the Death Star. I don't think the movie would have been the same without her, but you never hear about her","That's crazy. At least the guy who played Poe in The Force Awakens was able to shed light on Guatemela, since he was from there. Evidently, he insisted to be from Yavin 4 because that's where those scenes were filmed.","Yeah that's nice that they were able to help him out by making his character be from that planet. It's very strange to that George Lucas wanted Han Solo to be either a large green alien or a black man, and then we ended up with Harrison Ford LOL","And it's funny thinking about the companionship he had with Chewbacco later in life, if that had actually been a large green alien. Like Jaba the Hut??","Haha that's a good question. It's also interesting that Han Solo was a TIE fighter before he started to fly the Millennium Falcon. We didn't get to see that in the original movies, but I haven't seen solo, so maybe that's where it started?","Yeah, you get to see a lot of his origin story in Solo. He also worked as an Imperial Lieutenant.","Yep that's true. Did you say that you liked Deadpool by the way? I like the first movie more than the second, what about you?","I definitely liked the first one better. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for the part, which I suppose the creator Deadpool thought, too. He was described as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei.\"","Haha that's awesome! I'm glad that they were able to get him to play the role because that's so funny that it was in the comic like that. I also think it's interesting that the voice of the mystery villain is Ryan Reynolds too, in Deadpool 2, do you remember who the mystery voice was?","Yeah, the screenwriters said it was also Ryan Reynolds. It really is great. It's the highest grossing r-rated movie of all time!","Did you ever play the Deadpool video game? Apparently it cost more than the movie itself. I played the game and I actually liked it a lot, just like the movie in terms of the humor and violence","No, I didn't. I didn't even know there was one, to be honest! I wonder if there will be a Deadpool 3","I think there will be. I know that they're building up to it. So as long as they have a good script they will probably do it. Do you know who James Cameron and David Fincher are? They're both very famous directors and they helped to get the original Deadpool movie made in the first place","Yeah, they're both friends with Tim Miller, who only directed the first one. He left early in during the Deadpool 2 project due to creative differences.","Yeah that's interesting.

Are you a Star Wars fan?","I'm impartial, but I admire the creator George Lucas for his boldness and creativity to think outside the box and create a successful empire.","Yeah I agree, he created a whole following that is pretty intense these days!","Yeah and to think that film studios back then were convinced that the movie was going to flop thereby agreeing to a deal to forgo $500K in directing fees so that he can keep licensing and merchandising rights for himself. Genius!","Yeah what a good move, who would have thought how much the franchise would be worth today.","They do offer the film in numerous languages worldwide but only recently did they dub it in Navajo for Native American's, I would think that they understood English?","Yeah same here, but that is really cool that they would do that. Do you know how long it took James Earl Jones to record darth vaders lines for the first film?","No I'm not sure how long, but if I had to take a guess I would say one year? Am I close?","No, I guess it was only two and a half hours! He got paid $7500, but that was good money for under three hours of work!","oh my goodness! That is a great paycheck while others are making minimum wage! He probably also got payment as a result of license and merchandise deals too probably, except no one knows who the actor is or that he was in the film","Yeah right, good money for the time as well. Did you know Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo?","I wonder if AL Pacino regrets that decision. To not be casted after auditioning is one story, but to turn down an offer that's insane! I think I'm more of a Deadpool fan than Star Wars.","Yeah I bet, did you see the newest Deadpool movie that came out?","Of course! I really enjoy his sarcastic sense of humor but others don't get it. The video game actually cost more money to make than the movie. I don't play video games but that's insane!","Wow, that is incredible! And yeah I like how a superhero movie can be rated R and be fun!","Seriously! I think Ryan Reynolds did a great job, he's also the voice of the mystery villain!","I never knew that! Yeah he is a great actor and I think he is a really good person in real life as well.","I agree! He's hilarious in real life because I enjoy his interviews on talk shows. They did a great job of casting all the Marvel characters","Yeah they really did, I think most of all of the people they got are perfect for their roles.","I agree! Even the directors!

They can't replicate that again.","No. I thought Jar Jar Binx killed the next series of 3. Now I am worried they will be overexposed with all the movies and that will kill them.","Yeah he was really bad, I didn't like when they re-did the music scene in Return of the Jedi as well.","Yeah... Do you like the new ones that came out? I thought Solo was average. I expected more out of them...","I haven't seen the Solo one or the Last Jedi, but I really want to, I just have been so busy and didn't make it to the theaters.","Both are now out on Netflix. I watched Solo in two parts. Haven't seen the last Jedi. I am like you and too busy for theaters...","Yeah I liked the look of Solo from the previews, but I want to see both equally I would say.","Solo was OK. I have a hard time gauging the quality of it since it got bad reviews. I thought it was ok but lacked some meat.","Yeah and plus if you are a fan of the original ones before the 90's then all of them are hard to say they are good.","Maybe that's the issue... I am comparing them to the originals, which are almost perfect.","Yeah that is how I feel I am too, because they are that good where it is just impossible to replicate.","I am surprised that Star Wars was the first movie to be dubbed in Navajo and was the first major film to be dubbed in Native American. Seems like it should have been done before 2013\u2026","Yeah I am the same way, it took way too long, but I guess later is better than never.","Yeah.

Without Star Wars, the director James Cameron would have never quit his job as a truck driver","Good for him. Yeah that was because he is originally from guatemala and that is where the scenes were filmed","That makes sense. The whole saga as we know it is actually told by R2D2 centuries after it all occurs","Yeah. James Earl Jones was only paid $7500 for his reading of lines for 2.5 hours","He must have really believed in the project. Can you imagine if Bill Murray had gotten the role of Han Solo instead? It would feel like a completely different character","For sure. George Lucas' wife was also very involved in the scripts for the movie","That's awesome! That must have taken them a while. In the original, Han Solo was supposed to be secretly married to a Wookie. I'm sure someone has written fan fiction about that","Yeah I bet too. Yeah his wife made some awesome changes and actually won the academy award for it","Maybe she's the one responsible for the Han Solo and Leia romance.

He's one character of the Marvel Comics whom I don't have much interest in.

It's cool to know that she owns a business, especially a football team.","I feel like so many sports stars start to go into business once they have wayyyyy too much money","I know what you mean. Serena is surprising though. She's not only great at tennis but speaks french and itialian.","So is her sister! I wonder why","I don't know but it is impressive. Maybe she is an overachiever. She won a grand slam tournament while she was pregnant after all.","I'm shocked they let her play!","I was surprised too. I would have thought it would be dangerous for the baby but she played and didn't drop a single set.","apparently in 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world. Is that high? im not really sure. i wouldve expected it to be higher i guess","I don't know. With everything reported about her it does seem low. She's a very confident woman though. She said she could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in tennis and a man took up the challenge and beat her.","thats awkward haha her hubris got the best of her in that situation I guess","I guess so. She has reached a ranking of number one before so maybe that gave her the encouragement.","I hope so because she really is one of the greats. Shes even beaten Maria Sharapova","I think the only women ranked above her in some ranking is Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova."],"emotion":["surprised","positive"]},{"dialogue":["How's it going?

I recently heard that she is part co owner of the Miami Dolphins! I had no idea.","Yea Williams is a pretty good player, she kept one of her No. 1 rankings for 186 weeks straight","Wow, good for her! I know that some people consider grunting before a shot to be cheating but I don't know about that? I guess some people think its a form of cheating more or less.","It does sound annoying, but not as annoying as a helicopter being use to dry the grass on a tennis court like in the 1969 US open","Yeah, it does sound gross, I agree. I get used to it after a while. Serena went pro when she was only 13 years old. Another amazing fun fact.","I wonder what her longest match was and if it game close the the longest match in tennis history at 11 hours","Wow, that's a marathon!! What the heck. I heard that the longest rally was 643 shots, I think.","That's pretty crazy. The first US open was won in 1968 by the only black man to ever win the open","Wow, again. That is something else. 1968 was a long time ago. The longest rally went 29 mins too , i think.","Tennis player Gael Monfils beat one of the best paddle tennis players days after learning just how to play","Gosh, I wish I could play any sport. I heard ping pong wasn't even called ping pong but I am not very good at that one anyways. I guess its called table tennis officially. It is fun to play sometimes though.","Yea if your ok at it. Did you know Serena Williams won her 23rd grand slam when she was 2 months pregnant?","Noway, I was hugging something at 2 months and it wasn't a racket. That is crazy! It reminds me of a Katy Perry song.","Which one? Not one of her debut songs on the album Katy Hudson?","It was the Hear me Roar song, not sure which album though.","It's crazy Russel Brand ended his marriage with Perry over a text message","Gosh, yeah that was cold hearted!

Do you know much about tennis?","I never really played the sport. Maybe a couple of times. It always seemed complicated. Especially the score.","Yes the scoring is kind of weird for sure. Also weird is that until 1978 you could use any object as a racket, not just a tennis racket","How often did people show up with something different? That would be strange. I heard that they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open. That's probably how I would have handled it, too. LOL","Haha it's a good idea though! Just think what else could they have done? what's weird is that tennis is not very popular, soccer is the most popular sport because it makes more money than all other sports combined","Soccer is easy for anyone to play. Just a ball and a flat area. Not really any special equipment.","Yes that's a good point. I do think, thinking back to tennis though, that the longest point was a rally that lasted 29 minutes, that's so exhausting!","I can't imagine. They must have collapsed. The fans must have collapsed too.","Yep it was made of a 643 shot rally back and forth, that would definitely Tire anyone out, also do you think that when a player grunts while theyre playing that that is a form of cheating?","I don't. It probably sounds vulgar and classless to the elites that play and watch the game, but some people make noise. I think grunting shows intensity.","Yep I agree, sometimes it's just a natural sound that you make too. What do you think about Serena Williams by the way?","I think she has worked hard for her success. I heard that she said she would not retire when she was tired of tennis, but when she was tired of practicing.","It's impressive that she was born in 1981. That makes her four years older than me but incredibly much better at tennis LOL","I think that she has been involved since she was young. It takes a lifetime to get to her level. I guess she could raise her kids to be players, or become a coach.","She seems very successful though. I never realized that she was a co-owner of the dolphins","Yes, she plowed that cash into a great investment that will grow forever.","Yep I agree with you. I also didn't know she does a character voice in The Cartoon Avatar, she is very talented","What? That is a strange fact. I guess she had a chance to do the voice work. She is a celebrity, after all.","Did you ever play tennis? serena has been playing since she was 13, which is about when I started playing, but she's obviously way better LOL","I assumed that she started sooner. She must have picked it up quick. I didn't real play. Anyway, great chat!

Did you know that moon dust was harmful to humans? I had no idea.","I wonder if it's just the our moon's dust or if it's all moon's dust that is harmful.","It seems like they are all so different. Like Titan may have methane based life. I guess we'll just have to go see.","Something to look forward to right? Have you been to any good movies lately? Do you try and see ones that are box office hits or do you choose a movie for other reasons?","I rarely go to, or even watch any movies. I'm too fidgety and anyway they're not very good. Like Titanic was supposed to be so great but I never could bring myself to like DiCaprio.","Oh wow. I love movies. But I can see why you wouldn't. I'm not a fan of DiCaprio either. I wanted to like him after seeing What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but with each show after I liked him less and less.","Maybe I should have look at Gilbert Grape, that was his first big role I guess. Got him an oscar nomination, never won one for real though. Surprising for the amount of box office he's generated.","I don't follow the awards very close. I find I usually don't like the movies that are hits with the critics or generate huge box office revenue. I'm never heartbroken over who doesn't win LOL. I do love Tom Hanks though. In my eyes he is a great actor. I don't think I've seen a movie of his I didn't like if not love.","Yeah, Hanks has a way of pulling off so many different roles. $8.5 billion in total box office. And he's worth it. amazing range of roles.","I will always go to a movie he's in no matter what it's about. Watching him in Apollo 11 is what got me more interested in space that anything else. Up until then I had no idea the moon had mountains and valleys like the Earth. Even high than Mt. Everest!","That mountain is really shocking, considering how small and dense the moon is. Did you know that NASA actually considered putting a United Nations flag on the moon instead of U.S. That would have shook up things!","Oh wow! Can you imagine? It's such a source of pride here in the US. I'm glad it went the way it did. Did you know our moon is the 5th largest satellite in the Solar System?","Dunno about that. But consider this, if DiCaprio played the astronaut in Apollo 11 then we could have a new record for box office flop. That would have been huge!","So true! And no awards for that show since he seems to have a weird ability to not win any, deserved or not. Maybe working with Brad Pitt on Growing Pains jinxed him. Brad can't seem to do anything wrong.","look what happened to Matthew Perry, I'm wonder if he regrets sticking with TV? Lots of work putting a show out every week and not as much money although I'm sure it's plenty.","That's true too. I know Matthew Perry made at least one movie, I see it on TV once in a while but don't think I've ever watched start to finish so I'm not sure if it's good or not. I'd have to check the box office numbers to see if it was considered a success or not.","We didn't mention the Revenant. My Montana brother who's into that era history thought it was accurate. And DiCaprio really earned his money in that one getting beat up all the time. Or his double did,","Well, maybe there is hope for DiCaprio after all. I've heard some good things about that movie. It's been fun chatting with you. I'm in the mood to pop some popcorn and watch a Tom Hanks flick!","Good idea. Maybe you have encouraged me to see one too. Even if it is a flop, that can be a source of pride too. After all Sleeping Beauty was a box office flop too.","Well if you do I hope you enjoy it!! It's only a flop if you don't like it and I love most things Disney. Treasure Plant however was a box off flop that deserved that title for sure!","Enjoy what's in front of you, not a bad idea."],"emotion":["positive"]},{"dialogue":["I always thought that there was only one type of hockey - ice hockey.","The other type is field hockey.

I thought Canadians talked and dreamed only about hockey.","The other one is lacrosse.","Lacrosse is a grass sport, so I guess they play that in the summer. I don't know how well Canadian do internationally in lacrosse, but they sure do well internationally. They have a real rivalry with the US.","The US is just started to be competitive in ice hockey. A hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993 - do you know if it was a Canadian or American player?","I don't know. I would suspect that the Canadians would not go to the US for only $1.","You are right. Somehow I thought it was $1M and it was just a typo.","I've heard that hockey players can lose tons of weight in just one game. Serious exertion there.","Up to 8 pounds! That was what I heard.","I suppose that's mostly water. They can regain fluids pretty fast.","And it applies to professional hockey players mostly since they take hockey very seriously.","I always wondered how sports stadiums switched between basketball and hockey. The rink is right under the court!","I don't know how it works. I wish I knew the explanation.","I think they reassemble the floor in pieces over top the rink.","I'll bet Canada has dedicated ice hockey rings since the sport is their pride and joy. Perhaps basketball\/hockey stadiums are only in the US. I don't know.","The only place that could have both is Toronto.

In less than 24 hours, they are able to completely transform the whole arena, from basketball floor, to ice. It's funny, back in the day, hockey rinks only used to have one penalty box for both teams, so you'd have players from opposing teams, fight with each other in the boxes!","Oh wow! That is impressive. I didn't know they put them in the same box either. That's a recipe for disaster. Did you know that Canada has two national sports?","Interesting. you'd think that Canada's national sport would only be hockey, but I guess there's another sport, just as popular. Hockey is an interesting sport. you usually think of hockey games as being low scoring, but the Slovakian women's hockey team, once beat Bulgaria 82-0, it was ridiculous.","I can't imagine a hockey game scoring that high. I'm surprised when a team scores 5 or over. I can't see how it's possible to score 82.","It was a crazy game, they averaged 1 goal every 44 seconds. They would basically win the face-off, and center ice, and skate down, and score, every play.","Wow! I wonder what in the world the goalie was doing. Did you know that the average professional hockey players loses up to 8 pounds in one hockey game?!","seriously?! I had no idea. No wonder they have been known to bulk up with pasta's and heavy meals before games, because they know that they'd lose that weight anyway, haha","I would think you would have to load up or you'd pass out. Do you enjoy wrestling at all? Traditional or the flashy soapy kind?","I used to watch wrestling a lot as a kid, but nowadays, the story lines have just become ridiculous, and unwatchable to me. One of my favorite wrestlers was Macho Man, did you know he was actually signed to play with the St. Louis Cardinals, before he started wrestling? That guy was talented.","Oh I remember Macho Man. No I did not know that. It's very interesting. Were you aware that Abe Lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame?","I did know that he was a wrestler, but didn't know that he was in the hall of fame, that's awesome.","He was very accomplished. He only lost once in around 300 matches. Very impressive.","Wow, in today's world, that would, that would probably make him one of the top athletes. Neil Degrasse Tyson was actually undefeated in his high school wrestling career, and even wrestled for Harvard, but I have no idea how many matches he fought in","I did not know that about Tyson. He's a big man but I didn't peg him as an athlete. Before becoming a philosopher, Plato was also a professional wrestler.","See, that makes sense to me, because Plato was Greek, and Greek wrestling was hugely popular, and still is.","It makes sense to me as well. Since you mentioned Macho Man earlier, did you know that his outfits were designed by the same person who designed clothing for Jimi Hendrix and Aerosmith?","You know, I did not know that, but now that I think of it, that would completely make sense.

Seeing how a man was false imprisoned and taught himself law to prove is innocence is note worthy. That's probably how these successful people did well in life","That was note worthy, however there are often people who are born into a rich lifestyle that can get better quality education or know family or friends who are in high positions and I feel that is unfair. Aww, he had a little dog who was a certified therapy dog.","Right?! That's probably why he did so well in office. I think if we all had certified therapy dogs to help us with out work, we'd get more done.","It's my understanding that Mr. Hidgeon stayed with Patti Davis's mother, or Reagan's wife, that interests me.","I agree with you. It's hard not to think that he was not only family associate but almost like a family member, given all that he did for their family.

It seems that there would be a lot of people making it to 100 in Japan, versus the US.","I like the idea of libraries expanding to other things, like the Sacramento library where you can get things that useful like sewing machines.","I think that is a great idea, that way people can checkout things that they might need.

I think it's very funny to realize that the romans thought that wearing pants was a sign of barbarism!","Well I can see where they're coming from! I think the only reason people DO wear pants is because to ride a horse in an army, it was more effective to wear pants than robes.","Yes it was unless you were in britain where they rode side saddle. A lot of things are different there. They consider trousers to be underwear where america considers trousers to be pants.","That's really hard to imagine, for us I'm sure that seems insane.

Maybe he only had saggy pants left and was from Collinsville, Illinois where they prohibit them!","That is way way too much money for one pair and I hope he lost his case. However, being a judge he probably didn't. Now I do know about the Collinsville law. What i would like to know is just how do they enforce it. What is too saggy?","Exactly! I wonder where the line ends too. I bet they have a similar rule for shoes, like you can't have shoes too dusty or something!","Or too smelly! What they need in that case is some dry tea bags. Those are supposed to absorb odors in shoes.","I need to use that! I think I have old gym shoes that could use them. I definitely don't want to throw them out even though they are very old, because I believe very old shoes actually perform better than new shoes!","Oh they definitely do!

Who was your fav character in the movie?","I like Chris Pratt's character's interaction with the Racoons. It always makes me laugh.","Yes! thats true, I do love their interaction too. That movie has alot of great actors I couldnt pick just one. I am a movie aficionado.

It just rolls off the tounge!","Lol, yea, just rolls off haha I cant beleive how far the Marvel corp has come since their start in 1939!","Yeah. Has it been that long?","Yes, apparantly by the early 50's they had generally become Atlas comics and the Marvel branding began in the 60's... its gone through its own evolution.","That's crazy. I did read that there is a shared hero, access, between Marvel and DC to keep the two seperate. Inventive!","That is! thus they are so successful, as an outsider its cool to see the growth but im sure from their point it was a challenge and they fought through until reaching success...gives me hope :)","Agreed. I always feel bad for those who choose a side. I enjoy both sides so I won't choose.","Im happy to be in the middle too, I cant choose. Although fun fact...did you know Vin Diesel played Groot?

Avengers infinity war is the first film shot entirely in digital imax cameras.","That is great! i think the technical innovation will make the theater experience so much better.","The avengers movies caused a increase in shawarma sales lol","what?? that is funny. the kids saw it in the movie and decided they wanted to eat it? LOL","Most likely lol It was mentioned in a few movies and I guess it made everyone want some lol","Ok, that makes sense. do you have a favorite marvel hero?","hmmm I guess I like Thor, Ant Man and Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy.","I like spider-man. i dont know the films. i heard guardians was pretty funny though.","Yeah it was hilarious!! Spiderman is cool too,","Ok, there was a sequel to guardians too. was that funny?","Yes, both were really good.

For some reason I can see it. I can\\'t explain it though. The state rock song of Oklahoma is \"Do you Realize?\" by the Flaming Lips.","Wow, that's an interesting pick of songs, it's much more modern of a rock song than I'd imagine. I've been in coffee houses where they play both rock and jazz. It's nice.

Be nice if they did a reunion before it's too late. Whitesnake has had 50 members throughout their history! lol","Wow, that's a lot of members. It would be hard for a fan to keep track of them all!

A Hanson song became a most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because the djs did not reveal the name of the band. lol","Meant to say now he's got a lawsuit, not how, lol. That's funny about Hanson! Did you know Sweetgreen is a salad restaurant chain that used to have a music festival? Have you eaten there?","I've never heard of that place. lol Do you have any other details about it?","Only that it was sort of like Fresh Choice restaurants, and I have been there. Did you know some places play rock or other music so loud it can be a hazard for the people that work there? Scary.","I can believe that! The Led Zeppelin song \"Black Dog\" is named after a black lab that was wandering around the recording studio and doesn\\'t have any real relation to the song itself. That\\'s interesting!","I think it's funny how places are correlating loud rock music to eating pretty much junk food at restaurants. As if all people who like rock also like junk food? lol","Right? lol Led Zeppelin let Ben Affleck use \"When the Levee Breaks\" in Argo with condition he digitally alter the player\\'s needle drop to a correct spot on the record.","I really like how jack black got the rights to Led Zeppelin\\'s \"immigrant song\" for the School of Rock music. It was a creative way with 1000 fans backing him.","I liked that movie. Cool. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing. Hmmm...that's different. It's been fun chatting with you!","Wow, that's pretty funny! I had an ex in a jazz band and he played the trombone.

I read that if they play Rock music, like maybe Led Zeppelin...the customers seem to order a lot of burgers with cheese and fries along with a few beers lol","Even side salads are not even ordered, but bacon jam instead with the music louder.","Hhaha, that's so interesting. I guess when they play Jazz music, people tend to make good choices and order food that is good for them. I guess it makes all decision making easier...I better start listening to jazz more hahaaa","For real. I might try this trick while shopping. Maybe Ill make better food choices in the store.","Exactly! Actually they say some supermarkets use the music in the same way, more upbeat or ambient...it makes a difference.","Ive been to place with loud live music, it almost made me want to leave, but I did also want to drink more. That is really crazy to think how that works.","It is interesting, I guess when you go out to a place to have drinks and listen to a live band it's always so loud and it does amp you up.","Did you know that led zappelin helped to fund monty python and the holy grail?","What? That is cool. I love Monty Python and Led Zeppelin,","Pink floyd and Genesis were in on it too.","2 more great bands! The led Zeppelin song Black Dog...was named that because of a black lab that had been running around the studio, lol...they didn't even know the dog.","Wow. Crazy way to get a name for a band.","I agree, lol I guess it worked out well though. So many great older Rock Bands, and it is crazy they are still around. Like the the band Whitesnake, through the years had 50 band members! Wow...","Wow. Did you know Sonic the Hedgehog was supposed to be a member of a rock band initially?","Yes!

Why do you ask?","So aparently the band has so many members that the list needed its own wikipedia page.","HA! That's really funny. The state rock song of OK is by the flaming lips!","Do you like the band Led Zeppelin?","I do like them. Do you?","I do like them, there are many interesting facts about the band like how the song Black Dog is named after a labrador that happened to be at the studio at the right time and date.","I wonder if Sonic The Hedgehog was supposed to be a member of that band. He was supposed to have a girlfriend too!","I guess he did pretty good for a dog lol, his girlfriend was named Madonna so that is a lucky dog","I wonder if he likes jazz?","He might, jazz is a genre that has influence a lot of people so who knows, theres even a programming language that is influenced by jazz","It is seen as america's classical music.

The kids screaming must blend right in!","Yeah would be a good place to take kids for sure. I would find it a bit distracting if they played loud rock music. The classic rock version from the 1960's wouldn't be bad though.","Yea, they should play some Led Zeppelin, been around since 1968.","I would definitely be down with that. I think it's funny that Hanson song became a most requested track on a chicago alt-rock station because the dj's didn't reveal the band!","That's funny, and awful. whitesnake has apparently had 50+ members in their band over the years","Hard to believe. I saw some pretty good jazz in New orleans once. Wasn't a huge fan but it is definitely popular. Apparently the trumpet players grow a goatee for comfort when playing.","Interesting. I also see that clint eastwood is an enthusiast.","I had no idea it was popular in Pakistan given that their jazz orchestra is topping the charts.","apparnetly jack black made a video of himself with fans begging him to sing the immigrant song","I have actually never heard that song! But his band Tenacious D is pretty funny. Also Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be a member of a rock band and have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna. Rock is definitely out there.","I wonder what Sonic would play?","I am thinking either the electric guitar or drums. Led Zeppelin is definitely one of the biggest rock bands though.

Unfortunately, I can't bring my Game Boy to work, so it probably can't help with my soda addiction.","That's ok, at least it's not smoking. I have a coffee addiction so we're in the same boat. I had 4 cups today and I am dragging. What else do you do for fun?","I've got a ton of nerdy hobbies. I'm a Star Wars costumer in the 501st Legion, for starters. I'm also a historical reenactor. I also enjoy geocaching and running. How about you?","I have a full time job, teach college, have two kids a wife, and do a lot of HITs. I do not have a lot of time. I wake up at 4 to go to the by 4:30. I lift until 6:30 so I guess that is my free time.","Dang. I am NOT a morning person. I get up for work at 7. I might get up earlier than that for something I really want to do - like catching a plane or saving daylight for a long geocaching trip - but usually I prefer to sleep in. I also have a full time job, and a side gig, but I'm still single. I do have two roommates and a cat. My hobbies take up a lot of time, which is why playing video games is usually at the bottom of the list.","Waking up at 4 was tough when I first started but now, it's second nature. It's really a great option for me because I have no time to do it other wise. Its so relaxing and clears my mind.","I guess I could do it as long as I went to bed early enough. Typically I don't go to bed until around midnight.","I go to be at 8. I thought about it and I usually do nothing from 8 - midnight so I just cut out the tv and went to bed. It makes sense for me. Maybe go to the gym at night? My gym is open 24\/7 and I am not proud to say that I have been there at 11 pm on a friday!","I've pretty much already cut out tv. I don't pay for cable; I pretty much just watch stuff online or buy DVDs. I go running some evenings. I'm part of a local running group. Our current schedule is Saturdays at 9 am and Tuesdays at 6 pm. I've never really gone to the gym for anything. I think I'd like to try some strength training, but I don't know how to use any of the equipment, and I can't afford a personal trainer, so it's pretty intimidating.","Don't be intimidated. I'm sure you can figure it out. I usually just fake it until I figure it out.","Fair enough. With my running group, our mantra is no matter how we're doing, we're already doing better than everyone who's still on the couch. I'm not fast by any means - I doubt I'll ever win any age group awards or anything like that - but I get it done. Plus, it's better to run and then partake in bad habits (like drinking soda and sitting around playing video games) than to not run and still partake in bad habits.","True... Nice chatting with you!"],"emotion":["positive","conversational"]},{"dialogue":["Hi, have you ever played Tetris?","I think Tetris gives us principles for many things, like accommodating things on my trunk, It looks like it can have benefits like it can help quit smoking","ohhh really. I didnt know that I need to stop smoking. I will be looking into to. I wonder if they have it for the playstation. Probably you think?","It would be nice, and it is said that It can also help when sticking to a diet is difficult. Probably because you get addicted to the game and stop thinking about food","yeah youre totally right. So there must be a playstation game out there to help with addiction too. If the department of defense is using it, then I can use it for health.","Isn't that cool. that 1760 playstation 3's were used to build a super computer and it was a cheaper option!!","wow so cool. I feel like there must be a movie on this. I want to know all the history. I know playstation in itself wins so may awards or innovations. I want to see that come to life.","Did you know Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes?","oh I did not know that. I wonder how that is even happening. Very cool to know. I wonder what kind of music they're listening to while doing so. Maybe Jazz ;)","Do you like Jazz? I love it, one of my favorite types of Jazz is Gypsy jazz!!","I like it some. I like the women from Harlem who make music. Great piano players. know any?","Jazz is so unique and you find this sort of things, like this woman who holds a concert on sundays and has done it for 20 years!","yea and Pakistan jazz is currently at the top of that list. Thats so cool to find out","See, I always think about jazz from America and Europe but I really want to hear this orchestra from Pakistan, they must be great!","have to be. Im guessing rich in tradition... while we have our African Americans to help us stay connected to it all","Jazz has traveled everywhere, because in a great part it came from west Africa and then other things adopted from African american culture.","yes and then back to america to refine. I use to listen to the fatter tempo stuff as a kid","A famous actor who loves jazz is Clint Eastwood did you know that?","I do, Im not a fan of him then, to me that makes him kinda a poser","Well , it was very nice to talk to you today.

Seinfeld has way more money than Tom Hanks and Cruise together","WOw how much money does he have under his name then?","Well his net worth is $82 million","WOw that is a lot. Did you know Trey Parker and Matt Stone once got Cruise kick out of Paramount?","Wow what did he do? Cruise spent two years in Japan when he was preparing for the role of the samurai","WOw that is dedication. Cruise can never be a honorary citizen of Paris","Wow he must have rubbed them the wrong way somehow","I guess. DId you watch Avengers Infinity War?","I did, it is the first film shot with digital imax cameras","Nice. The guy who played Jarvis in Iron Man has never seen the films","Cool. DO you know who is the waitress that Captain America saves in the Avengers movie?","I have no idea, is it someone we have seen elsewhere too?","Yes that was also gretchen in Recess","Oh nice.

He's pretty dedicated.","that is hardcore dedication for sure. aladdin's face was based on him","That's funny! I never made the connection. He seems like he's a bit out of touch with the average person's reality though. He decided to spend $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. Does he know something we don't?","it might seem like it, since he invested all that money","Maybe he can sell it for a profit later on, and use his celebrity status to up the price. Are you a fan of the Star Wars films?","yeah that is possible. that will still not be enough to lift the ban that the city of paris put on him","Paris banned Tom Cruise? Why?","not sure, he must have done something. well they put a ban on declaring him a honorary citizen","Oh, ok. I haven't really kept up on the Star Wars films. After the first three, they lost their magic to me.","yeah seems like with most movies, the first few are so good and then it is downhill","Lucas has never won an Oscar, but his wife has. George will just have to make do with his billions.","well she is the one who made some remarkable changes to the script so I think she derves it","Yeah, George really needs a guiding hand on things or he just doesn't focus the story. He's creative, but might have trouble with story structure.","yeah. 20th century fox thought the movie was going to flop","Lucas got the merchandising rights and the rest is history. The franchise has made many people rich. James Earl Jones was paid $7,500 for the first movie, but I bet he got a bunch more in the next ones.","yeah that is pretty remarkable, there is no way of knowing when the next genius is going to strike","Probably JJ Abrams. He seems to have the touch. I enjoyed chatting! Have a good evening!"],"emotion":["intelligent","positive","curious"]},{"dialogue":["Hi do you like movies?","That is cool, do not do it as often. One of the ones that I admire the most is star wars series which started in 1977","For sure - Star Wars has been an epic anthology, save for the middle 3 (first 3), but I did enjoy all of them and can't wait for the new ones!","It is still alive!! Did you know that back in 2013 it was dubbed in Navajo?","I did not know that - I wonder how many languages it has been translated to? Or how many countries it's been released in - fascinating!","I imagine many many languages but this was neat because it is the first major film put in an american native langauge","Awesome - The Navajo community is very relevant where I live and I had no idea that Star Wars was the first major film ever translated to a Native American language. Assuming it was all 9+ of the movies?","I would imagine that. I found interesting that Marcia Lucas, George's wife influenced the movies","I have heard that before, especially with the first movie, she had a lot of input and influence on scenes and characters. I bet they have a solid relationship!","She had to do with Obi Wans death, and Leia's good luck kiss, and she did a good job because she won an academy award.","Carrie Fisher (Leia) won an Oscar for Star Wars? Those are all vivid, iconic scenes - even with the later revelation that Luke and Leia are brother\/sister..","That is pure fiction!! Did you know that Darth Vader's lines were recorded in about 2.5 hours?","2.5 hours seems about right, he didn't speak very often - mostly just heavy breathing...","hahaha that is true, James earl Jones got paid $7500 for that.","Vader's voice (JEJ) is probably my favorite childhood memory of Star Wars. The first time I saw it, the voice was so calm, unique and creepy","It sure did get stuck in our minds, I think he should have been paid more!!","Seems fair for 1977 and they had no idea it was going to be a billion dollar industry - no way!","looking from that perpective, it is probably fine, but Star Wars got so big that it even holds a Guiness record for being succesful in merchandising, and I think we all want to have something from star wars","Amazing how they've kept it going and gotten better in most aspects. The Last Jedi was awesome!","I think they make us dream!! Well it has been nice talking to you!"],"emotion":["positive","awe"]},{"dialogue":["Do you like Star Wars?","Not that much though I think it's a awesome franchise.

I hear that the entire star wars is actually told by r2d2 hundred of years after the jedi!","Wow, I had to wrap my mind around that. George Lucas' wife put in many little details in the film. SHe got an Academy Award for editing. Her husband didn't get an award for directing.","Yeah that is amazing! Have you watched avengers infinity war?","I haven't actually. I hear it's the first film ever to be shot completely with digital imax cameras.","Yeah the next movie is coming out next month, it was left with a pretty big cliff hanger.","Interesting. So it is the 2nd in a trilogy?","I have no idea if its going to be a trilogy. it is the 3 movie in the avenger series, but the next one is going to be the 4th.","Oh, I see. Wow, I am really behind. I have not seen any of them. Also, do they eat shawarma in the films?","Yeah Tony Stark talks about eating shawarma in the first one and I think hes eating it in the other 2 lol Now its a thing.","Oh, I see, that's why shawarma sales increased. Now I want one.","Its not a big scene lol amazing what a little tv time can do.","Right, haha! When I was younger I used to watch the hulk.

I was thinking of getting the one with Playstation 4 if I can ever get enough money. I also want to get Dead Red Redemption 2. I heard a reviewer say it was \"jaw dropping\" good.","VR scares me some, especially when designers are trying to get you addidcted","I was thinking about how people just sit in chairs hours on end staring straight ahead doing VR. Then I started thinking people used to do that with TV. After coming home from work and eating dinner they would sit in front of the TV staring straight ahead not moving for hours until they went to bed. At least with VR you are moving your hands and with some games your whole body.","Absolutely agree and Tetris is a puzzle game that requires fast thinking, geometric skills, and other brain skills. The jazz music will also serve to stimulate brain synapsis, so not all bad I guess","I was surprised to find out that playing it has positive effects. Like for people suffering from PTSD. Or those trying to stick to diets. I might start playing the original version again until I can get a PS4.","That is an interesting fact. There are a few versions available on Android and Apple devices for free. But yeah, the VR set up is going to be a super high demand product, especially for the age group that played it as a game boy game","I play GTA 5 on my PS3 now. I am really into flight simulators and that one is the best for console I think until I get a PC that can handle one. I can't believe PS3s are researching Black Holes.","I was just reading about Tetris selling 495 million copies of of its franchise. That is enormous","I can't believe the original creator didn't get any royalties cause it went to the Soviet Union. I guess it isn't copyrighted cause there are so many free ones now. At least he started getting some royalties in 1996. I don't how with so many free versions out there.","Hopefully he will be involved in the VR version and Sony can do the right thing and get him caught up.

Not sure how that is possible as that game was terrible","Actually the new one for Playstation VR was designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the Japanese designer of the game Rez, which I have never heard of.

I don't follow sports anymore. I am into hiking in the mountains now. I have only had PSs not any XBOXs.","Healthy stuff, outdoors, always good. I worry that VR pulls people away from that","If you play mobile games have you heard of ELOH? I play it some. I find it relaxing. What mobile games do you recommend I try?","I like the Clash of Clans genre, Clash Royale ect. I like the social aspect of playing with others versus solo","Sounds good.

I never made the connection between the two myself. What I find the most interesting about the story is that Black Panther is the richest superhero. You have to have an incredible imagination to put all those details into a character like that. The background information is fascinating.","Yep, Black Panther is the richest superhero, he has more money than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark","Yeah, richer than just about anyone real or fictional I would guess. I would have guessed Bruce Wayne was the richest superhero but I haven't really been into Marvel until recently. I think it's nice how these young actors get to play superheros their parents grew up with. I had no idea they used real historical information either.

I never knew India ever had the number one economy in the world!","Not only did India have a great economy, they were also very knowledgeable in mathematics, metallurgy, astronomy, medicine, navigation, water management, and textiles","It's not surprising that India still produces so many mathematicians, engineers, and doctors. Centuries later those talents seem to be ingrained culturally. It's amazing that they had such a large university so long ago. The invasion in 1193 didn't stop their progress altogether. That's what I can determination!","I found it fascinating how many cultures studied astronomy. Not only did ancient Indians study it so did ancient Babylonians","The study of astronomy probably began when ancient cultures realized they could use it to navigate. I didn't realize there were different branches of astronomy. They probably began with observational astronomy and it developed into theoretical as time went on. When they realized there was a lot more going on than just lights in the sky. It's all fascinating but probably above my thinking. All that math and theoretical stuff makes my head hurt.","Using astronomy researchers were able to date events such as odysseus taking back the throne of Ithaca","I really enjoy historical information like that.

No I do not play any instruments, I wished I played the guitar.","I started when I was six and played until I was seventeen, but then we moved and I had to give up my piano. Haven't played since, sadly, but I loved it. Maybe you should try guitar!","Oh no! That's terrible! Piano sounds are beautiful, what made you start learning the instrument? I have given the guitar a few tries, but without the foundation of music, it is so difficult to play. I admire those self-taught people.","It was actually my mom's idea - she wanted us all to learn an instrument, so she bought us a piano and some books and taught us at home. I know what you mean about not having a foundation of music. I felt so clumsy and clueless starting out.","Wow! I really want my kids to play an instrument and would love them to learn the piano, were you apprehensive to it at first? I don't want to force my kids but when I hear about the statistics of the benefits classical music, I really want my kids to learn it.","It wasn't really intimidating since I started so young. It was just another thing to learn, like math or English, and it was fun too. What kid doesn't like making noise? It also helped that my mom let me play on my own in between instructional periods.","Great insight! That's very true, what scares me is asking these kids to sit and focus their attention on it. Thanks for the info! I can't believe that there is a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain! Would the keys still function if it snowed?!","As long as the piano stays closed so snow doesn't clog the chords inside, it probably would play just fine. Unless it's an electric piano. Then I think snow might cause some electrical issues!","Oh wow! That's super neat. Do you enjoy poetry? So many people speculated about Shakespeare's sexuality, whatever it was, he wrote some great pieces.","I love poetry. I've read some of Shakespeare's sonnets (and his plays!), and they have such creative, lyrical beauty. I didn't know there was speculation about his sexuality, just that he was married to Anne Hathaway.","I wondered if the celebrity Anne Hathaway's name is inspired from that. I had no idea Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time! They would've seemed to live in different eras to me.","Pocahontas and Shakespeare being contemporaries is surprising to think about. I had the same surprised reaction to finding out Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr. were born in the same year.","Yeah! What?! That's crazy! Is there a particular piece of work you enjoy of Shakespeare's?","My favorite play of his is Hamlet, with Macbeth a close runner-up. I can't say I have a favorite sonnet, though. Each has its unique appeal. Do you have a favorite?","Yeah, those are really good ones. I don't typically have a favorite but enjoyed each one of them.

Have you seen Infinity War? Its the first film to ever be shot entirely with imax cameras!","I haven't yet. I bet that's pretty intense. There are a ton of actors in it; almost too much to follow. I guess that's why they needed the Imax cameras, huh?","I guess so, I guess the voice actor that plays Iron Man has never ever seen the movies.","Actually, the character Jarvis hasn't been in the films. But that's a bit of a fib because Jarvis becomes Vision and is played by the same actor, Paul Bettany","That's interesting, thanks for clearing that up. Did you know that Disney isn't allowed to show big marvel characters east of the Mississippi due to a contract they signed?","It's kind of funny how the ownership of the Marvel properties works. Sony still owns Spiderman so he only shows up if Sony let's Disney have him. This is why his appearances in Iron Man and Avengers are really short.","That\\'s so weird. They created a character called Blue Ear for a little boy who was afraid to wear his hearing aids and told his mom \"But Super heroes don\\'t wear hearing aids.\" So Marvel made one that did. So sweet.","Yeah, overall they really care about their fans. And there are a lot of them at this point. Did you know there are over 19 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? And more every year!","I had no idea. I didn't even realize there were so many characters until not too long ago. I didn't watch or read comic books when I was a kid, so I was only familiar with Superman and Batman. I had never heard of Deadpool, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, or any of those guys. I bet Sony wishes they had taken Marvel up on their offer to buy them out for 25 million. I think SOny thought people would only care about Spiderman.","I think at the time, they were right. the mcu didn't really take off until Iron Man in 2008. Still, I bet someone at Sony got yelled at for that one.","What's the deal with that character Access? I head that he is owned by both companies and his job is solely to make sure that the two companies' universes separate?","I don't know, but its too bad we couldn't see a DC\/Marvel cross over. Superman meets the Avengers? Sign me up.","I bet that would be fun. My husband and son would love it if they did that. I guess Marvel argued successfully in court that mutants were not people, and so they got to pay the lower rate on X-Men toys instead of the higher rate for dolls. SO much interesting trivia.","That's kind of ironic considering much of the X-Men story is about how mutants are the same as humans and deserve equality.","Ha, that is ironic. I was thinking that that might send a weird message to their child fans.","I think people overthink what children might think. However, I think there are certain characters that just are not for kids. Like Deadpool. The merc with a mouth. It was really a good thing they rate it R.","That's what husband said. I guess the first one was the highest grossing R rated feature of all time after The Passion of the Christ. My husband said it definitely wasn't a kids movie.","I heard 2 takes it even further with the crudeness. I enjoyed the first one, it definitely didn't hold back, but it also didn't feel forced. Just felt like this is the character and this is the life he leads which is full of sex, violence, and swearing.","I used to think that kind of thing was funny, but now that I'm getting older it seems very distasteful to me. I guess I probably just don't want my kid saying stuff like that. I thought SuperHeroes were supposed to be for kids. Although, I guess maybe the movies are for the people that USED to be kids.","Maybe that is the appeal of someone like Deadpool. He's a superhero, but he's not for kids. They are probably trying to capture a whole new audience that doesn't include kids.","That makes more sense. Kids don't have any money, you have to get the parents roped back in if you want them to buy the kids all the expensive toys and movies and stuff. Unless they're mutant toys, because those are cheaper.","They also have been doing on so long that they have a nice audience of young adults who grew up with all the Marvel movies that they can now afford to buy a lot of useless \"toys\" themselves.","Yup. My husband has a bigger collection of SUperhero stuff than he probably ever did when he was a kid. They must make SO much off of merchandise alone.","Their licensing department really went crazy. But people buy it so maybe not.","I read the Avengers caused a notable increase in Shawarma sales, why would that be, do you know?","I think they make a big point of eating it at some point. It really shows how big of an impact the MCU has, huh?","It really does, lol","I don't think you get to be almost 20 films strong and not have at least some influence on society.","No, I don't suppose you do.

I read an article pointing out the plot points that culminated in Avengers: Infinity War and it blew my mind. That one has quite a cast of impressive actors. I'd never imagined Idris Elba and Paul Bettany in superhero movies, but the MCU is a whole different beast.","I would agree totally. There have been like 19 MCU movies in the last ten years... That's two per year!","I have friends that have watched them all. I can't imagine having the time to do that! The fact that they're now releasing them so quickly and close together really keeps the excitement up. The last 3 movies that came out did better than previous titles, and I wonder if they're going to keep doing that- just to keep ticket sales booming.","As long as there are sure-fire $ to be made, Hollywood will invest. And with the noticeable trend that pushing through one great story after another yields steady revenues, I think I will stay far behind...","Do watch Thor: Ragnarok. It's so much fun. It's a different tone than most super hero movies, because the director, Taika Waititi let the cast improvise. It's very loose and enormously fun.","That sounds great! Was Ragnorok the second or third in the Thor series?","It was the second. I think. I might be wrong, but it's definitely the most memorable one for me. I do enjoy Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Can you imagine if he would have been cast as Thor? I can't get my head around that.","After watching the first thor ovie (2011) I cannot imagine Loki and Thor any different than who played them. What else can you tell me about this?about","Well, in thinking about it, Ragnarok was the third movie in the Thor series. I had forgotten the second one entirely! Hiddleston put on 50 pounds of muscle to play Thor, and I would like to see what that looks like on him. Apparently he screen tested, so it's got to be on the internet somewhere!","Really? What is the Infinity Gauntlet?","It's the glove-like thing that Thanos collects the infinity stones into. The stones are hidden all around the universe and once he has them, he can wreak havoc on mankind. They're sort of hidden in all of the MCU movies, in one way or another.","Bizarre, but interesting! I remember watching all the X-men movies, and really connecting with the humanity of the mutant characters. Is then shocked me when I learned that Marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people in order to reduce cost of producing X-men toys. Seems ironic!","Right?! It's kind of anti-Xmen, because they are people! I'd love to have a great X Men movie sometime. I'd love it if they were added to the MCU, because there are some excellent Xmen characters. It's weird that in Orlando, there are lots of Marvel characters at Disney World, but some of them are only at Universal Studios.","Yeah, strange to have \"rights\" to imaginary figures... Maybe that is one reason why SOny balked at the chance to buy cinematic rights to most of the Marvel characters for a mere $25 mil.","They have to be kicking themselves! And then they spent $10 million only on Spiderman?! There are such good stories to be told that are already written in the comics!","Yeah. So many characters and so many stories, it is not surprising that the Marvel and DC created a character, Access, that straddles the two reality to help them to keep track of and keep separate the two universes. If they need help keeping this stuff straight, I have't got a chance!","I remember when he was created- they did a crossover between Marvel and DC. It was a clever idea. I know I'd watch a movie about BlueEar, the superhero who wears hearing aids.","Yeah. I would even watch a movie about Jarvis!

I bet they are regretting that decision big time by now each hero is worth hundreds of millions.","Sony did for 25 million dollars. They could have made so much money!

Do you know who Jarvis is?","I know Jarvis, I think he was played by Paul Bettany","Yeah well Paul Bettany has never seen the films, how crazy is that, he's a big icon of the saga and hasnt bothered to watch his own work in action.","wow, how do you not see yourself lol. I would watch a movie I was in like 100 times!

I guess Ant Man wasnt popular back then, I love Loki, his a great villain\/hero\/trickmaster","Agree, Wow, Tom Hiddeston gain 50 pounds of muscle for the film.","I think he nailed the role of Loki, he was considered for the role of Thor at first, did you watch Thor Ragnarok?","Yeah, interesting about the infinity gauntlet during the movie being right-handed, in the comics its left-handed.","That is funny,, the film had a great director, Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, I think he made a great job directing the film","I do too! Thor had so many good actors in it.

It seems like an odd contract to sign that they can't show them east of the Mississippi.","Yes, very weird. I'm surprised they haven't paid enough money to Marvel to be allowed to show the big Marvel characters.

I would like to know, though, how Marvel was able to argue that x-men are not human?","Yes, for sure! They are mostly human but just with mutant genes. Guess since they are different they found a loophole to avoid paying the higher rates","Who knew there was a loophole for fictional characters!","Haha, for sure! I guess people can become very creative when it comes to different ways avoiding to pay more money. I think it's so cool that Avengers infinity war was shot entirely with digital imax cameras.

I wonder what his powers were? Michael Jackson wanted to play Spiderman.","Michael seemed to want to be a lot of things.","Isn\\'t that the truth. He tried to buy Marvel in the 1990\\'s, just so he could produce and star in Spiderman. He was an add one. At least Marvel is smart and it didn\\'t happen.

There is such a need for statisticians in today's sports.","I have not looked into that avenue specifically, but I will definitely check it out.","Yeah, I see more and more teams even starting their own analytics department to look for value in the numbers.

I wonder if it would be easier to learning with singles or doubles","I figure with singles, I would learn from my mistakes faster. The equipment was too expensive for me as a kid, plus there were no courts around.","Same for me growing up. Now I live in an area that has a lot of courts. I can't imagine playing a match that lasts 11 hours though, even if it's spread over three days","I guess they both wanted that bonus! 11 hours, though. Did anybody watch the entire thing?","I'm not sure, but there would have had to have been as least a referee or someone else, right? I wonder if they wore polo shirts since they were created for tennis players","Those shirts seem comfortable but a bit too stylish for serious athletes. I guess it's important to be stylin' while bashing a ball.","They might be have practicality to them too for sports like tennis and polo. I guess polo shirt is a little more catchy than tennis shirt would be","The tennis world seems to skew to the high end. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open. That's the solution I would have come up with too. LOL","That's actually a genius solution though. Maybe that's why most courts now aren't on grass. At the US Open the year before that, a black man won the title, and that's the only year a black man has won","The sport favors the rich. To get to that level, you need equipment, courts, and most of all, coaching. Black kids in the US just don't have access.

In ancient greek books there are some weird romances but they rarely mention kissing for instance.","I had also heard that. Apparently romantic kissing is a fairly recent development. I wonder why that is?","No idea, I'm sure you can find the answer in a book. Unless it's been destroyed.","Ugh, that's always upsetting. The FDA burned six tons of literature in the US as an act of censorship. What a waste. It makes me so angry.","Yeah, a lot of those can never be recovered. Fortunately these days with e books it's virtually impossible to destroy literature as a digital copy will always remain.","I certainly hope they don't find a way. Have you heard that there is a yearly contest tat challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel?","I have not, but you'd think it wouldn't be too difficult to do. There are some pretty bad books out there. This is non fiction but I was just reading about boots if you can believe that. I thought it would be bad but it was interesting.","Oh really. What was an interesting fact you came across?","Nokia used to make boots! That's what they were known for. Given how their phones have gone lately maybe they should go back to boots.","What?! I never would have expected that. Here's one. Do you know why Ugg boots were invented?","Yes, that was in the book too. For surfers to keep their feet warm. You wouldn't think boots are interesting but honestly I was fascinated learning about them.","You would think they would absorb a lot of water and become uncomfortable. They do not seem very water repellent.","The earlier models were a lot different the the uggs of today. Before trucks farmers used to make little boots for turkeys they'd walk to markets. You would think a wagon or something like that would be more efficient.","Ha ha, boots for turkeys. That is a hilarious image. I would love to see that.","I just don't see how that would have been cost effective. Especially with the turkeys sold for meat once they reach their destination.","Me either. Do you know what the phrase \"pulling oneself up by their bootstraps\" used to mean?","No, I don't think that was mentioned in the book, but I am curious...","It originally meant \"doing something that is pretty much impossible\".

They booed her conduct.","Didn't they both they both get booed at the trophy presentation ceremony?","I'm not sure why they would boo Osaka.","I'm not sure, but she made a speech stating to give everyone the credit where credit is due. Let's not boo anymore, and to congratulate Naomi.","That was the right thing to do. But the umpires are still upset at the situation.","She really shouldn't have acted like that. It wasn't very professional.","But people like Billy Jean King say there is a double standard, that umpires are much more tolerant of that kind of behavior from men than from women.","I read they have threatened to boycott William's future matches","I wonder if that will come to pass.","The umpires believe they are being abandoned by the WTA.","Umpire Ramos is very well respected. Other umpires wonder if they could end up like him.","I know they feel that no one has their back when they make unpopular calls, but they have to understand that happens in every sport.","When you are a referee, you take guff from everyone.","That is very true.

I think they draw a lot of unfair criticism because of how good they are.","True. I think it also has to do with sex and race. Serena was criticized some time ago for \"having a meltdown\" in an exchange with an umpire but I\\'ve seen much, much, MUCH worse from other players and they don\\'t get criticism about it","That is partially true but Serena does have a habit of losing her temper on the court. I think she puts a lot of pressure on herself and can sometimes lash out when things don't go her way. I believe she once threatened a tennis judge before that incident.","Maybe so. It must be hard being her. She was in the hospital after giving birth and had blood clots in her lungs and the doctors wouldn\\'t listen to her until it was almost too late. She often has to \"act out\" to be heard","I really felt bad for her opponent in that match, she had her big moment overshadowed","That's true. Or maybe it brought her more attention? When you have a huge tennis star like Serena Williams freaking out over your move, that tells people you did pretty well...","Usually I would say that is true but I would be curious to see how many people could name her opponent in that match versus how many just remember that there was controversy.","Good point! I only just learned that it was Naomi Osaka, meanwhile I heard about this incident so long ago","Hopefully for Serena's sake she can learn to express herself in tough situations like some other big time athletes in stressful situations. I don't remember Steph Curry ever having a bad moment such as this during his career. He seems to keep cool under pressure.","I don't even know who he is. Or if he should be weighing in on this","He's one of the best basketball players in the league today. As a contemporary black athlete and a big advocate for women in sports, I think he has a valid opinion for this.","Speaking of Serena, she co-owns the Miami Dolphins","I remember when the Dolphins were sold and they brought in a lot of celebrities to invest as part of the group. I believe Marc Antony and J-Lo also have part ownership of the team.","I'd love to have enough money to invest in a sports team.

They just brought in new coaches so maybe they can start to turn it around.","You seem to know more about sports than me. How do they compare to the Golden State Warriors? My limited knowledge tells me that they're good lol","The Golden State Warriors are more like the New England Patriots if you want a football comparison. Both teams are dominant and constantly in the hunt for championships.","Wait, are the Miami Dolphins and Golden State Warriors not even teams of the same sport??","No they are not. The Dolphins are a football team and the Warriors are a basketball team.","I should know this stuff. I have a sibling in San Francisco, but I'm not big into basketball or football myself.

I would like to see how fast they pitch to each other!","Not sure. Did you know there is also a fantasy congress league!","Really, I wonder how you would even score points in a league like that. Can you imagine people getting into a fight over their fantasy congress league as well?","Points are based off of legislative success.

Does Elmo wear Ugg boots?","That I can't tell you, but I don't know why he would have to come in or at least the character, but I think I remember when that happened actually.","True. I know some of the muppets would wear rubber boots like those Nokia used to make.","Yeah I never knew that about Nokia, who would have thought. I guess they still make them.","I wonder if they ever made boots for Turkeys! A quarter million turkeys used to be walked from Norfolk to London in custom boots.","Really, I wonder why in the world that would happen!

I find the language a little difficult at times. There are some hidden jokes that are clever puns. They get lost as english changes.","It's always hard when starting but you get caught in the rhythm pretty quickly. It's hard to believe that he was alive at the same time as Pocahontas.","Alas, poor Pocahontas, I knew her well. I would like the idea of my skull being used in Hamlet to play Yorick. It would be funny, but I would know nothing.","Ha ha, Hamlet is probably my favorite Shakespeare work. I revisited it in college and loved it. I was very surprised to learn that he invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia. We use those names so much now and they seem so simple compared to most of his names.","I wonder if we really know the man Shakespeare was? There are few records. We read his works and presume to know what he thought. Few records for commoners from the day. Unlike our lives which will have records forever.","That's a good question. I would be interested in learning more about that. We always think of drama with Shakespeare but he also wrote comedies. Do you enjoy comedies?","I always appreciate comedy. Have learned that some movies are referred to as bromantic comedies. I dont like the name, do like the movie. Harold and Kumar was funny.","I like lots of those. I like Step Brothers and I Love You Man a lot. I like Demetri Martin's stand-up. He was accepted into Harvard law school but decided to do stand-up instead. He always seemed very intelligent to me.","I do not know who Demetri Martin is. Dropping out of school to pursue comedy is a common thing though, Ryan Stiles is a funny guy. He was on the Drew Cary show a while ago.","I definitely remember him. Tall, slim man. I love Bill Murray so much. Are you a fan?","Bill Murray is the man. Dogs and cats sleeping together. I have never watched Kung Fu Hustle. I need to look for that. You know it?","He is amazing. He is a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle. I have seen it. It's okay but I'm going to have to disagree with him on how good it is. It's really not that great.","I will keep that in mind. There are many levels to comedy. Some is pure visual, some is strictly words. It is funny to think about the three stooges, buster keton, slapstick with and without words.","That is true. Kung Fu Hustle is very visual and slapstick heavy. I realized that 3rd Rock From the Sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy series in 1997. That is surprising.","3rd rock beating Seinfeld, Friends and Frasier. Four great comedy shows airing in the same year. Network TV was at its height. Now things are fractured by internet channels. Great show though.","I did enjoy it but it certainly did not hold up as well as Seinfeld or maybe even Friends.","I do agree that 3rd rock is not showing in reruns.

That could include black comedies as well","I like comedies, including black comedies, and bromances too. You?","Well I like old school stuff like Monty Python haha.

I'm not sure about the theory that domesticated animals develop patches on their head though because that is seen in while horses too.","Yeah, I rarely ever see that but an interesting fact to learn about. I've always been excited about space exploration. It's pretty funny to learn about the restrictions of astronauts due to gravity, like they can't whistle in a spacesuit.","That is a neat fact. I wonder if there is a way to harnass the water vapor that is in space to help eliminate drought on earth.","That'll be really neat, maybe scientists are studying it. I wish the same effect could be applied to thunder, if we could harness the electricity from one thunder strike, it would be enough to power the entire earth for at least five minutes!","The earth is an amazing creation. I wonder what the practical applications could be of the drop pods to deploy anywhere on earth. It could have humanitarian impacts.","Agreed. There should be courses around the concept of space offered in schools!","I think it would be awesome to offer a stem class in the mechanics of space engineering. There are so many intricate things that people don't even know.","Yeah, when I was in school, there was only computer science being offered, but I hope that there are more of STEM classes as well in middle school\/high school rather than in college.","There does seem to be a push for STEM activites in younger people which is great. Practical applications always are necessary to learn.","Yeah, I think movies like Thor sparks creativity in children, I highly encourage teens to watch Marvel movies and read the comics.","Creativity gives us a new lens on the world. I think all scientists need more creativity in their life if we are going to think of out of the box solutions to the worlds problems.","Yes, I know I get completely absorbed in those movies and think about the universe and the life on other planets as well.","I think the creativity allows us to access the right\/left brain connections that aren't always used in everyday life.","Yeah, even when trying to improvise a dialogue in thor, that seems stimulating as well haha","The way they tie these films together like with the gauntlet and the ravens is amazing.

It's owned by Warner brothers so there you go, ha ha","I mean some even said it was the worst mob movie of all time. Also you are right, the marketing team for Gotti did a good job turning the situation around to gather a greater following.","Netflix has about 150 movies with a score of 100% on RT.","I wonder how good those 150 movies are. I have to say though that most of the time, Rotten Tomatoes does a very good job of rating its movies, much better than imdb.","Hey you remember Siskel & Ebert?","Is that a movie?","No they we're the original rotten tomatoes. they use to come on tv Sundays i think an actually review movies with clips it was pretty cool.","Oh! I have never heard of or used Siskel & Ebert before. I used rotten tomatoes ever since I saw spykids after seeing that it had a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes","13 years before the sequel there was a video game called the incredibles raise of the underminer.","It is too bad that no film based on video games have gotten above 44%. Speaking of incredibles raise of the underminer, have you seen the incredibles?","I saw the first one, i enjoyed it...Funny!! It's set in the 60's a pretty good time period.","I also enjoyed incredibles 2 created by walt disney. Most sequels don't do very well, but disney did a good job.","I did not see the second one but im sure your right. Apparently Disney thought about closing their animation studio because Sleeping Beauty did so bad.","Well its weird that Sleeping Beauty did so bad considering how iconic it is today. Although I'm sure their experience with treasure planet in the box office sure didn't help","Ha ha! You know it's all about the mighty dollar. I didn't realize that Tom Hanks is the highest movie earnings of all time. 8.5 million. is that from toy story you think?","I mean he is a star capable of carrying the whole movie by himself to an amazing degree. It is better to pay a good actor rather than flop like trojan wars The movie with a budge of 15million only earned 309 dollars in box office","That's one i never got to see either, doge a bullet you say, ha ha!

What do you make of that? Marketing? Or are the critics wrong?","I think it could be a little of both. Sometimes, fans want to prove the critics wrong.","Yes, that's true. Did you know that Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Warner Brothers?","No, I didn\\'t. I also have no idea what it means when something is \"fresh\" on rotten tomatoes. Do you know?","I think \"fresh\" means recommended - the percent of critics who support the film. But, with it being owned by a major studio, you have to wonder about bias.","I agree. Maybe the studio liked it, and other people didn't...or vice versa.","It would be interesting to study how WB films fare there versus their biggest competitors, and versus independent films.","Yes. The Toy Story movies have a 100% rating, though, and I don't believe they are Warner Bros movies.","Yes, and Spykids got 93%. If there is bias, it's probably subtle, but who knows.","Have you seen SpyKids? I haven't. I loved that movie about the superhero kids in high school. What was that called?","I haven't seen it. Did you know that Disney almost shut down their animation studios after Sleeping Beauty came out? It did very poorly at the box office.","No, I didn't know that. I don't think I have ever seen the movie, Sleeping Beauty, although I did have the paper dolls when I was a little girl.","Yeah, Disney's had some ups and downs. Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive box office failures of all time.","Is that the one that was a Muppet movie? Oh, no I think that was Treasure Island. I didn't see either one of those. Disney has had some box office home runs, though, like the whole Pirates of the Caribbean series.","Yes, they've had a lot of success! I find it comforting to think of them having failures too - we all have our ups and downs.","Yes. It makes it seem a little less like Disney is taking over the world.

It was not brief and made me feel bad about myself.","It was pretty long indeed lol, but I guess the title says brief because of how big the universe actually is and it would take an enormous book to document only what we know up to date in a summarized way","Did you read it? I ever tried reading it upside down so it would force me to read it more carefully and concentrate. Only book I had trouble with. Well, that and organic chemistry.","I tried to read it and read some pages but never finished it, you know that there are scientists who believe that universes also evolve through natural selection","That's weird.

I guess thats a valid theory as well, we know so little about space everything is possible.","Like there is only one electron in the universe?

Believe it or not, even classical music had loud, wild, moving audiences during performances back in the day.","Oh for sure, you ever see the movie Armadeus? It really was the popular music of the time","Yeah. Even today, some fans are so obsessed with the music it is amazing. Like, there is one dude, Arthur Lintgen, who can identify a piece of classical music by simply looking at the grooves on a vinyl record.","Classical music have also been used to decrease crime in cities all over the world, it's fascinating.","Yeah, and to curb teen loitering in shopping centers.

Since you mentioned fantasy drafting earlier, people also draft members of congress.","I did not know that! Did you know people were writing fantasy novels in the 2nd century? I was reading about that the other day!","I did not. Wow, fantasy has a very long history. I do love Game of Thrones. Apparently George RR Martin was hesitant to include the dragons but someone convinced him. I am thrilled that they did.","I loved GOT. I wonder if the books are better then the show?","I decided not to read them. I have friends that did and they said that he is way too descriptive. He will have a whole section describing the food at a dinner. I'll stick to the show. Just as a side note, it was a person named Phyllis Einstein that convinced him about the dragons.","Oh really? The dragons were fun. I found it hard to keep up with the show sometimes. I felt like Martin had us all over the place for a fantasy.","It does get complicated. I love the intrigue though. I am amazed that the longest work of fantasy is three million words long! That's insanely long.","That is a lot of writing. I once heard a janitor in Chicago wrote a 15,000 page manuscript, but i have never seen it. He must have been writing for awhile.","I wish he would have shared it. He potentially could have had a lucrative career.","I would love to read it. I guess he did a lot of illustrations in it too.","I would love to see that."],"emotion":["interesting","positive","amazed"]},{"dialogue":["hi how are you? are you interested in fantasy?","I know a little about the genre.

I want to read that fantasy novel that was written in the 2nd century! It talked about the moon, aliens, and war between planets. My mind is blown!","Wow. that is quite imaginative. i wonder who wrote it. that is amazing!","I'm still in shock people thought of that back then. It does make me believe in aliens haha. I don't know if I have time to read the longest work of fiction ever though.","Is that the one by the janitor?","No but close! This one had 3 million words in it!","That is insane. I wonder how long it took to write that many words.","I don't even want to know I would be so bored haha. Are you into science at all?","I like science. i enjoyed it in high school. You?","Same here. There was only one scientist that has walked on the moon which is nuts!","I think the astronauts are selected from a pool of pilots. not a whole lot of pure scientists there. in the future that could change.","I hope so because I feel they put all the work in!","Yes the scientists and engineers dont get to enjoy the fruits of their labor! Maybe Elon can change things.","I hope so! That's cool that Japan's emperor is a scientist! We need minds like that in more in control of society!","There will be a new emperor in Japan this year.

Are you a fan of comic books at all?","I am a fan of comic books, its sad Stan Lee died.","At least he lived a long, productive, and successful life! I am also a fan of comic books, but it is an expensive hobby and I stopped collecting a while ago.","He did, he ended every phone conversation with the phrase excelsior, and I can see why its expensive although it can also be considered as an investment.","I guess if I am able to drive to Michigan State University in East Lansing, I can read what I want without costing an arm and a leg.

I used to be all about Marvel when I was younger, but I got into DC later. What about you?","I do like them as well, DC comics is called Detective Comics, I didnt know that.","Ha! So Detective Comics Comics! :) You mentioned Stan Lee earlier. Although the creator of Marvel Comics, he actually wrote 15 DC comics!","Wow I didnt know that, I bet those comics are pretty good, I wonder if there are available at the Michigan State University.","They might be a good place to start! I guess not all superheroes are in comics, because I heard the US is home to 300 registered superheroes.","So many superheroes! there is a superhero called normalman, I bet he is a lousy superhero lol.","I can't imagine he has a lot to offer, but it sounds sort of interesting.","He has a hard job though, he lives on a planet that's full of superheroes."],"emotion":["positive","informative"]},{"dialogue":["Hello!

Ironically in the 2001 comic book Deadpool described himself as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei\". That led Reynolds to believe he was destined to play the role.","He was destined to play the role since the Deadpool character was butchered in that X-Men movie. Destiny required they do the character justice this time.","lol Do you read comic books? I haven't read them since I was a kid.","I really only read manga and Alan Moore comics sometimes. Did you know they've been around in Japan since the 18th century??","My one son is a huge Manga fan. I remember one of the first book series he was into when he was younger was One Piece. I had no idea they've been around since then. I know the first modern comic book in the US came out in 1933.","One Piece is great! You should look into it. It gets better after the first few chapters. And isn't that comic called Famous Funnies?","I have no idea! LOLOL I had enough of a time trying to figure out buying One Piece books for him. That was all so new to me. Didn't understand the genre. Was a big learning curve for me. lolol","Ha ha, I can understand that. If you were a superhero, you'd be normalman! Apparently he's an actual superhero ha ha.","haha. Good stuff! There are over 300 registered superheroes in the US.","We should go an register too. You ever heard of One Punch Man? You can be Genos and I'll be Saitama. We'll be the best out of those 300 for sure.","Nice! My son would love that I'm sure. haha I'll have to look up One Punch Man.

I think that came along after my time as well. LOL I just googled One punch man. My son loves those japanese anime shows like that as well.","Your son sounds like a cool cat yo. But is he as cool as Stan Lee and say \"excelsior\" to end his phone calls??","LOL That's great! I just learned that DC from DC comics stands for Detective Comics.

What i found most interesting was that the Video game cost more to make than the Movie (Deadpool)","Yes, but I hated how it ended with him being weapon X and sewing his mouth shut! The character is known for his snarky humor, they wasted a great characters in that movie for e.g. Gambit. I didn't know about the video game that's an interesting thing to know. Were there any other X-force members in comics apart from what they have shown in the movie?","There was a handful that was missing from X-Force but really the team is just comedic timing.","I just read in the article that there was comic with Garfield & his gang as Pet Force. That got a chuckle out of me imagining Odie as a super powered dog. Do you like Garfield comic strips?","i can only imagine Garfield eating his way through problems and Odie fixing everything","Haha, That's true and poor Jon would be pulling his hair out. Just a question, did Marvel do comic books series like DC's Elseworlds?","Marvel does so many comic and there was so many topics back in the 70s and 80s im sure that they would have anything. Just last week Marvel released a League of Legends themed comic with Riot Games","Wow, the more I get to know about this stuff the deeper it goes. It's interesting to note that Michigan state university library has the largest comic book collection publicly available in the world.","Yes, i found that extremely interested and i wished i would have known that sooner as i no longer live in the region i would have spent a good deal of time there. but what i did find funny was that DC mean detective comics. but they go by DC comics","That would have been great, right? All the comic books you wanted to read. Yes, the DC & Comics again seems redundant, What did you think of Zazie beetz as Domino I think she got the role right with her attitude as happy go lucky survivor.","She did do the role very well. but i think what really got me was you had both Josh Brolin, played Thanos and Cable and if the MCU every does a crossover it be weird","Haha True that, I used to think what would happen if Fantastic Four(before the new rehash) did a cross over with Avengers who would Chris Evans play The Human Torch or Captain America? Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern would probably never do a cross over with Deadpool universe but the end credits scene put a bullet in it literally.","well it would be captain America for sure, though i heard that Deadpool will no longer be making another sequel but maybe make one more movie as Xforce","Yeah, I am like waiting to see how End Game Pans out. But I thought the X-Force was dead with all of them in chunks literally. Though I would love to see a Wolverine & Deadpool team up if possible.","Wolverine and Deapool team up would be cool but really just want to see a Hulk VS film the animated short films are amazing and seeing a Hulk VS Deadpool would be fun with the merc with a mouth","It really is sad to see copyrights marring such great ideas of having Super-heroes or super-villains team up. I loved how they tried to include the Planet Hulk timeline in Thor:Ragnarok but I think a Standalone film would be better to connect with the character.","yes agreed, but i would highly reccommend the animated series when watching some of the Marvel Universe as they are able to do so much more without the copyright restrictions as oppose to live action. but one thing for sure is i definite need to do more research on \"Normalman\" that would be a fun read","I would have to check that out too, and Normalman sounds fun I would also check that out.","Yep between Normalman and the female reimaginations of the Marvel universe would be good. but a live action film with a multiverse would be cool like the new animated spiderman would be next level and interesting.","Let's not get into the multiverse right now, it's too huge for my mind to comprehend right now!

It's a lot more tongue and cheek. Also, I can't believe that they didn't bring the first director back, they should have definitely done that it may have been a better movie","Did you ever read the comics? Hardcore comic fans seemed to lament the inconsistencies between the comics and the films.","I'm not that into Comics so it doesn't bother me, but I guess it would bother some people, did you ever play the Deadpool video game by the way? I did it's really good","I am not too into video games. The video game cost more than to make the movie!","That's very impressive! And yes the video game was awesome like I mentioned, also the movie is the highest grossing R-rated film of all time, if you don't include movies directed by James Cameron or George Lucas","I thought it was a really unique film, quite different than the other superhero films because it was just for adults, and rated R, not PG 13.","Yes I agree. It was a breath of fresh air, you should also know that Ryan Reynolds does the voice of the mystery Villain at the end of Deadpool 2, I'm not ruining anything for you though haha","In a 2004 comic Deadpool described himself as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei, so Reynolds thought he was destined for the role.","That is really funny! I'm glad they were able to get Ryan Reynolds in the movies then, do you read any other comic books by the way?","I don't really. I tried to get into them when I was in 3rd grade because it was trendy in my school.

LOL. Did you have a preference between Marvel or DC when you used to read comics?","well I liked xmen as a kid, now that i'm older I like batman the best but thats the only DC character I like, below him would be xmen, spiderman, etc I think marvel has more characters that I like but batman is my favorite, you?","I was pretty much all Marvel, with a couple exceptions when I was younger, and then became all DC the second time around. It's funny I didn't realize DC Comics was like saying Detective Comics Comics.","haha no I didn't know that either, kind of like how gmail.com was originally purchased from a garfield forum because thats what the name gmail was based on","You learn something knew every day.

Apparently Demetri Martin wrote a palindrome poem that is 224 words in length","I think it's something to do with words being the same after a certain pattern but w\/e it is I couldn't write a 224 word Palindrome","On a different topic what do you think about Birds by the way? I did eat a chicken for dinner and it was delicious","Birds are pretty awesome, they are technically dinosaurs so I find it fascinating to see living dinosaurs","Yes I agree, it's very crazy that they can range in size from 2 inches to over 9 feet","Yea, it's crazy birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the extinction event 66 million years ago but they are hardy species","What do you think about the dodo bird? I'm kind of sad that it is extinct but at least it is related to pigeons","I would love to of seen a real dodo, they look much cooler than pigeons","Yep I agree. It's crazy to me that bird bones are actually Hollow and weigh less than their feathers","Yea that is pretty amazing, so are the birds who migrate straight to mexico from Alaska without sleeping","Yes I wish I could stay awake that long LOL, what do you think about hummingbirds that steal spider webs? They use them to make nests","Pretty cool, I guess the webs must help keep things together in the Hummingbirds nest","Another topic, do you think we will ever go to Mars? Apparently you would have a higher sounding voice on mars because of the difference in atmosphere","Probably not for a while due to all the iron oxide and other hazards on Mars","It's weird that there is bacteria that could actually survive on Mars, I don't think there is life on there unfortunately though"],"emotion":["entertained","informative","interested","fascinated","positive"]},{"dialogue":["I love the first iron man movie!","Robert downey jr does a great job at playing tony stark","He gets paid so much!

I'm not big on superhero films, though I did like the Deadpool films. It was a shame that Stan Lee died.","Yeah, stan lee was awesome! He's an animal!","He always ended his phone conversations with the word Excelsior! Not sure why though. I guess it sounds cool.

Huge following!","That's cool it's filmed in Ireland. ALways wanted to go there","It costs like a million an episode. One of Charlie Chaplin's descendents is in the series. Would you name your daughter Arya?","i like the name... but woulld not name my daughter a trendy name","I would name my daughter Hodor, in honor of the giant who says only his name.","LOL... ummmmm ok! There's also a descendant of charles dickens","Yes, I wonder how many descendants Dickens has. Might quite a large number. Half of London, maybe.","It's crazy howmany countries they've filmed in","I think it's part of the charm of the series. The writers must have a lot of fun choosing interesting backdrops.","yeah of course, and good for the actors that get to go to all those countries!","Tourism goes up in the countries where the filming is done. I would think that governments would do what they could to attract GoT episodes.","True!

I didn't know until after seeing it that the executive producer was Ralphie from A Christmas Story!","Was it really? It's amazing it turned out as good as it did, then. I bet it was chaotic! I think it's also crazy the guy who voiced Jarvis still hasn't seen any of the Iron Man films. It's like why? Ha!","Yes it's why it's so energetic. I would have been terrified. I didn't know that either. I often wonder why some actors don't watch their films.","It must be an insecurity or something. I'd still want to watch and support myself! Even if I only got half a million for the first movie like Robert Downey Jr. did (even though he made $10 million for the sequel).","I would be too curious about how it turned out. Apparently it was totally worth it for Downey to do the first then since he got such a crazy pay boost for the second. I also feel that he revitalized his career.","Agreed. And he did so with a movie that is based on a character Stan Lee created only because he figured no one would like him. Now he's probably the most famous comic book character today! Ha!","I agree. Do you also enjoy Game of Thrones? I love that show.","I do, actually! So much so, if I ever have a daughter, I wouldn't mind naming it Arya. Ha! It's also the fastest rising name for girls in America!","I'm not surprised. I talked a friend out of doing that because I knew it would happen. Do you remember the character Viserys Targaryen?","Yes I do! Isn't he also a descendent of Charles Dickens? Guess that explains how he got famous, right? Ha!","He is he is the great-great-great grandson of Dickens. On the same note do you know who the actress that played Robb Stark's wife Talisa is related to?","I heard it was Charlie Chaplin. Did they require you to be a relative of a legend during the casting process or something? Ha! I suppose it makes it so much easier to be picked knowing you have Chaplin or Dickens' blood in you!","Ha ha I guess so because yes she is the granddaughter of Chaplin.","Got you! So have you ever watched the Nat Geo show Game of Lions? It basically showcases the lives of different lions as if they're actual Game of Thrones characters. It's very interesting and entertaining.","Ha ha, no. I had no idea that existed. It does sound interesting. Did you know that Game of Thrones is largely filmed in Ireland?","I did and also heard the tourism there finances it. That is crazy! I mentioned lions earlier and speaking of lions, they say animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they're domesticated. I wonder if that applies to lions as well?","Good question. I wonder if it's just that one animal that has to be domesticated or the whole species?","It's definitely worth looking into, I suppose!

I'll re-watch it, because I remember that I enjoyed it a lot! That film grossed $585 million on a $140 million budget to prove it!","Yeah Marvel for sure made a lot of money off that movie. Do you have an interest in animals?","Yes I do! Quite a lot of interest actually! What about you?","Yes me too. DO you know how many animals are in the world, individuals?","I didn't but had to find out! It's 20 quintillion animals on this earth! That's crazy! The number broke my brain! lol","I do not even know how many zeroes are in that number , to be honest","same! I'm horrific at math! lol So, I just found out that in 2002 Germany became the first country in the world to give non-human animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights! Wow, we should do the same! That's good to hear that any country did that! We have a lot of animal abuse and neglect issues that might be addressed if we did so.","That is very true and it is sad so maybe we can remain hopeful since there are governments in other countries who are doing something about it","Ernst Haeckel who divided the animal kingdom into 2 classes, animalia and protozoa, also happened to make some of my most favorite artworks ever! You should check out the animal diagrams that he created! They are so good!","Wow, I will do that. Do you have a pet?","I sure do! :) Do you? I have cats, dogs and fish! But I\\'ve had a huge amount of \"animal friends\" throughout my life! Also I\\'d love to get chickens if I had the space, so that I could raise them for eggs. I aspire to be a kind of farmer. That is to live with a bunch of plants and animals. lol","Yeah, I have a dog and I heard that they develop white patches on the forehead if they are domesticated but I have not seen it in my dog","Interesting! Yeah I have a black dog and I guess I'm going to be checking her head for white patches later on to test that theory! :)","Yeah. Do you know why we still have hiccups?","No. Why?","An overlap of the time when we had both gills and lungs","Oh wow! That's so cool! I'm really into science stuff, I'm going to look into that!

Did you know Downey Jr. only made 500 thousand for Iron Man, but made 10 million for Iron Man 2?","Wow what a huge contrast, well deserving though he is the man behind the success! Stan Lee created Iron Man because he thought no one would like him!","Stan Lee is awesome. Stinks that he passed away recently. He lived a long good life.","Yeah he was a mastermind behind all the comics. Did you know the first ironman movie was filmed without a script?","Oh wow that's amazing. Tony Stark's captors are revealing the entire movie plot in a language called urdu in the beginning of Iron Man.","So cool. I also really like animals. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth!","That's a ton of animals! There is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.","Power to the animals! Germany also protects them as they were the first country to universally give animals constitutional rights!","That's hilarious! There's a jellyfish that can live forever.","Wow. blessing and a curse I suppose. I hate getting the hiccups but apparently its from early evolution of having both gills and lungs.","I agree. That's funny, I didn't know that about hiccups.","Yeah. There are also cool animals on TV like in Game of Thrones or in other words A Song of Fire and Ice.","Animals have a dominant paw like humans.","Oh I wonder if most are right paw dominant like us?

Not sure exactly how that is calculated.","I heard Michael B Jordan did a great job acting as the Black Panther.","And Chadwick Boseman couldn't afford to go to a prestigious summer theater program. He got funding through a private benefactor who actually was denzel washington.","Denzel is awesome.. I was sad that Stan Lee a creator of the comics had died last year.

I guess I would say Superman, because I used to like to watch the Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman when I was a kid. How about you?","I actually like Blue Ear because of the story behind the character.","Hmm, I haven't heard of that one. I find it interesting that Marvel offered all their characters to Sony for $25 million and that offer was rejected in 1998.","They probably lost a lot of revenue. Blue Ear was created because a 4 year old was uncomfortable wearing hearing aides.","That's an interesting story. Yes, I am sure they lost a lot of money since all sorts of superheroes are extremely popular these days.","I guess you could look up the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes to find the good superhero movies.","Yes, Rotten Tomatoes is a good resource. I just learned it is owned by Warner Bros.","They seem to own everything. Michael Bays movies have an average rating of 38%.","I can't believe that Spykids got a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I didnt' feel it was that good.","I don't like Spy Kids at all. I thought it was too hokey.","Yeah, it definitely wasn't fun for me. It has a better rating than The Dark Knight Rises, for instance, which is surprising.","Netflix has 150 movies available with a 100% rating.

It sounds real good. Is it based on a comic or something?","It is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. But Black Panther himself actually made his debut in Captain America: Civil War in 2014!","I dint see that one either. There are alot of superheros out there and a bunch of films with them. Marvel? Is that the batman, and the superman?","I honestly don't know. But I do know, surprisingly enough, That Black Panther is actually the richest superhero with an estimated networth of $500 billion. That's more than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark combined! That is crazy, isn't it?","I guess any thing is possable in the superhero unaverse. I could be rich if i were a superhero.","So true! Speaking of money, Marvel actually offered 5he cinematic rights of nearly all of its characters to Sony for $25 million but they would only purchase Spider-Man's rights for $10 million thinking movie goers would only like him. Boy, was that a mistake on Sony's part!","Boy, they WERE dumb. $25 million? That aint hardly nothin for Sony.","Agreed! I think it's also crazy that Disney doesn't own the rights to the characters like Spider-Man,X-Men, Avengers, etc. in theme parks on the east side of the Mississippi river because of a contract they signed with Universal Studios back in the 1990s!","That is a odd legal scramble over those characters. I think that it would be better to buy them all and not have the confusion.","Agreed. Speaking of legal scrambles, Marvel was successful in their court arguments that mutants weren't people and thus, were able to pay lower rates on X-Men toys instead of higher rates for the dolls simply because they're not technically human. I thought that was funny!","I agree. Totally. Funny! It's a good idea to be human in the US, but not if you're a doll. I see now how I should proceed if I get a species change in the future.","Ha! No kidding! Since we're on the subject of comic book characters and movies, are you familiar with Rotten Tomatoes? I never knew until recently that they were owned by Warner Bros.","I use Rotten Tomatoes for many things. They got rid of the best parts of it though. Now its just got regular movies on there. Still, its good enough.","Agreed. I think it's sad that Michael Bay's average movie rating on Rotten Tomatoes is an abysmal 38%.

And then, no video game based movie has received a rating over 44% on the site either. That's sad as well.","That sounds wrong. Those movies have a loyal fan base. I figure something must be good in there.","So true! And I thought it was surprising Spy Kids received a higher rating than both The Dark Knight Rises and Lincoln. Spy Kids got a 93%.

I originally started with DC comics but the Marvel characters seemed more nuanced. They really got some big league actors in that Infinity film including Robert Downey Jr. and Josh Brolin.","Have you heard of Blue Ear?

It sure was successful.","They used to have to draw animation frames by hand, so they also reused some in movies in the 70s.","Yeah, I can imagine. Drawing by hand requires a lot of effort.","Yes. That undoubtedly made each frame costly. Disney is one of the Big Six film makers, and of course they do things that are not animated.","Yes, they own Marvel right?","No. Marvel hocked all of their hero rights to borrow money to build their own production company.

All I think is a Molly Ringwald 80s movie. Well, anyway what's so funny about Robert Downey Jr. is that he hid food while he was on the set and the crew could never find the food he hid, so they just kept letting him do it. Some of the scenes in the movie are some of the food he hid.","LOL...Was Robert Downey\\'s character called \"Flash\" or something? I can\\'t remember, been years since I saw it.

Heck, I can't believe this is already the 19th film from Marvel Comics.","Hey, you're never too old. I'm a grandparent myself! Lol I did see Big Hero 6 with my grandsons and it's a good little cartoon movie.

I'm gonna have to watch that Walt Disney picture again...put a smile on my face.","Yes, it is a classic for sure and I too love the Beatles. Have you ever seen the Pixar move,\"UP\"?","I've never even heard of it. What's it about?","It's a Children's cartoon movie, it's kind of sad, to me. It's about a little old man that ties balloons to his house to float it to his and his dead wife's favorite place.

I like the science to be futuristic, but realistic enough to appear attainable. I also like sci-fi based on books, like Hunger Games.","How about more serious films like a space odyssey?","Space Odyssey is based on a short story titled \"The Sentinel\". So, it has a place on my favorites lists. How about Sci-Fi books? 2018 had some winners.","I tend to watch scifi movies more. Did you know that scifi films have become even more popular since star wars and nasa even has a list of accurate space terms to help writers write scifi stories?","Considering the imaginary concepts (e.g. Star Trek transporter), I think it is good that NASA emphasizes real definitions for actual terms and concepts. What I find interesting is that some Sci-Fi actors may no longer be regular actors but still have high earning at conventions signing autographs, etc.","Well that explains why fan conventions are tremendously lucrative for actors, making 100K+ in one weekend","I wonder if the NASA list has a definition for \"Hyperloop\"? As of late, I have not heard much about Elon Musk\\'s hyperloop tunnel in SoCal. Do you think it will work?","Elon Muzk has founded many innovative companies and the hyperloop tunnel was such a type of plan he would have. I have rather been hearing more about his aerospace company spaceX","SpaceX id definitely a leader in private space transportation and exploration. It also highlights Elon's weird (and expensive) sense of humor. Did you know he short a cheese wheel into space as a tribute to Monty Python's cheese shop sketch?","I guess he has interest in improv and acting. He even produced and acted in thank you for smoking.","It also seems like the acting bug bit his wife as well. She made an appearance in the \"Inception\" movie. Are you interested in being one of the first to join Elon\\'s first transport to colonize Mars?","The first perhaps, but I think I would much rather go to mars after everything is proven to work","So true, The first traveler will be true explorers, going in knowing that success, if it occurs, will be a hard fought struggle. But, then perhaps they can ask the alien commander from 3rd Rock from the Sun for survival tips... LOL","Who knows? Maybe they will teach Elon musk how to build a vertical take off supersonic, electric passenger jet that he so desires to build","He does have a vivid imagination and deep enough pockets to dream that big. But, some of his antics are humorous. In a way they remind me of a old British comedy Sci Fi TV series \"Red Dwarf\".","I enjoy the Red Dwarf too. I enjoy comedy in general since it encourages laughter and focuses on humor.","Agreed. I have a reading list on my e-reader. Glancing over it, I see I am weak in Sci-Fi. So, I am thinking of adding some new releases.

In any case, I will also consider reading this book. Thank you for your time chatting today","I like the way the author has rubbed shoulders with Steve Jons and Elon Musk.

Nicholson's Joker was the one that really, really brought home how psychopathic the character could be. Heath Ledger's Joker was pretty scary as well.

Did you know female superheroes are sometimes called superheroine?","I think that Super-heroine is actually more correct grammatically, but a few more letters to pronounce.
